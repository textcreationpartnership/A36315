            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Man at firſt was made the moſt noble and moſt excellent creature of all Gods viſible works; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with ſuch powers that he was capable of knowing, loving, and enjoying God his maker as his happineſs, felicity, and end; created free from ſin and corruption, and free from ſorrow and affliction; t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ough not free from temptation, nor from a poſſibility of loſing his freedom,
<pb facs="tcp:43501:3"/> yet he had a power and a liberty to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in that condition, without any neceſſity of coaction to depart from it.</p>
            <p>But this free and noble creature aſſaulted and ſet upon by the crafty and malicious Serpent, and left to the freedom of his own will, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with, and overcome by Satan, to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs the law of his maker, and violate his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, proved an Apoſtate, and turned rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God that gave him his being, and that good condition in which he was created, who by the abuſing of his liberty loſt his freedom, and brought himſelf and all his poſterity into an eſtate of ſlavery and bondage, out of which he was no way able to help himſelf.</p>
            <p>Man lying in this pitiful plight, in this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn, miſerable, and deplorable condition, the God of grace and mercy (of his meer grace and mercy) did commiſerate, ſeek after him, find him out, and made known a way of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for him, even by the Incarnation, Paſſion, and Crucifixion of his own Son; which he did more and more clearly in ſeveral ages diſcover to the captivated children of enthralled <hi>Adam;</hi> whereas he provided no Redeemer for fallen An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but where they fell, there they lye, bound in chains of darkneſs, without hope of help, or poſſibility of recovery to all eternity. Behold, ye Captive Sons of men, a remedy for you, but not for Devils; for God ſent not his Son to take upon him the nature of Angels, but the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:43501:4"/> ſeed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and that when the Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing Angels ſinned, and were falling down to hell, Chriſt did not take hold on them; but on man (when by reaſon of ſin he was tumbling and ſinking into everlaſting miſery) he did take hold, and ſnatched him from the flames of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal burnings, from the curſe of the Law, and from the intolerable wrath of an angry and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked God.</p>
            <p>This God and Saviour that did foreſee your thraldom and bondage, did from all eternity agree and covenant betwixt themſelves in this way of Redemption to afford you ſuccour and relief; that Chriſt ſhould become your Surety, and be bound for you, that were bound, and died for you that ſhould eternally have died, and ſet you at liberty by paying down a valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ranſom for you; of which you ſhould be partakers, if you turn from ſin to God, from Satan to his Son, heartily conſenting to take him for your Lord-Redeemer, for your Prophet, Prieſt, and King, to rule, inſtruct, ſanctifie and ſave you; reſigning up your ſelves and all you have and are to him, preferring him before all, loving him above all, believing on him, and obeying of him ſincerely, conſtantly, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally, without partiality, and ſinful, ſecret reſervations; and if you like not him, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept not of deliverance from your bonds and fetters upon theſe conditions, you muſt lye and periſh in your chains of ſin and guilt for ever.</p>
            <pb n="199" facs="tcp:43501:4"/>
            <p>This is that Redeemer that is preached, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and tendered unto you: This is He, and He alone that can make you free, and if he do, you ſhall be free indeed; accept him as he is offered, and deliverance and ſalvation is come unto you; refuſe him, ſlight him, or neglect him finally, and you are Captives with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ranſom irrecoverably. All of you by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were in this ſtate of ſpiritual Captivity, and all of you now are Bond or Free: For as there are but two places in the other world appointed by God to be receptacles of mens Souls, namely, Heaven and Hell; ſo in this world there are but two ſorts of men (ſo diſtinguiſhed by their ſpiritual ſtate) Captives or Free; the one continuing ſo, ſo ſhall be plunged into hell; the other ſhall be poſſeſſed of heaven. Under which of theſe you are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, you may be helped to diſcern, if you will read, conſider, ſearch, and pray: If you find your ſelves yet Captives, to know your miſery, and the Chains wherewith you are bound, and how to get them off, read the former part of this little book: If Free, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame your hearts with love to your Redeemer and Surety, that paid the ranſom for you; and learn how you are engaged to hearty and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting thankfulneſs for his mercy towards you; and to expreſs it by holy walking while you live, conſult the latter part of this Treatiſe. In all which I have endeavoured to uſe plainneſs
<pb facs="tcp:43501:5"/> of ſpeech, avoiding hard words and terms of art, as alſo controverſies that might have been brought into this ſubject; concerning the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Will of man, concerning the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, and ſuch like, contenting my ſelf with what may ſuit the end I aimed at in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, the awakening of the Conſcience of Captive-ſinners, that are faſt aſleep in their fetters and bonds of iniquity; and the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the more ignorant to ſight and ſenſe of their neceſſity of deliverance by Chriſt; (as for the more knowing, let them read the works of men of more knowledg); for if I may by any means help the weak and ignorant, that cannot underſtand the elaborate works of the more judicious, I ſhall account it a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar mercy: For if I could, I dare not <hi>uſually,</hi> when I am to ſpeak in the Name of God to immortal Souls, ſoar aloft above the capacity of the meaneſt; the ſtrong might ſtoop to the plainneſs of wholeſom words, when the weak and ignorant cannot come up to the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what is more ſublime; though rude and undigeſted matter becometh not the place of any that ſtands to ſpeak to people going to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, about things of everlaſting concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet I judg, that he ſhall have but little comfort another day, that ſtands and ſpeaks one word for Chriſt, and two or ten for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; a little to ſet forth Chriſt, and much to ſet forth his own parts: If any look for ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:43501:5"/> things here, that they may not loſe their labour, let me deſire them to lay it by, for you will not find it: But that this in its plain dreſs and ſtile, without all pomp of words, being read by you, or any others, might be to the profit of you or them, is the deſire, and ſhall be the prayers of him that is</p>

               <p>THeſe words, though true of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> yet have principally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference unto Chriſt; who going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Synagogue on the Sabbath-day, choſe theſe words for his Text, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it, to the admiration of his hearers, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 18. And applied theſe words unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as chiefly intended <hi>v.</hi> 21. Other holy men of God had the Spirit of the Lord upon them, and was imparted to them, by which they ſpake, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11. &amp; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21; But Chriſt in a more
<pb facs="tcp:43501:10"/> eminent manner and meaſure, <hi>Iſa. 11. 2, And the ſpirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him, the ſpirit of wiſdom and underſtanding, the ſpirit of counſel and might, the ſpirit of knowledg and of the fear of the Lord.</hi> Iſa. 42. 1, <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my ſoul delighteth: I have put my ſpirit upon him, he ſhall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.</hi> Yea, Chriſt had the Spirit more abundantly than all others, <hi>Joh. 3. 34, For he whom God hath ſent, ſpeaketh the words of God; for God giveth not the ſpirit by meaſure unto him.</hi> All Believers are anointed of God, have received a ſpiritual and holy Unction in ſome meaſure of ſanctifying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 21, Now he which eſtabliſheth us with you in Chriſt, and hath anointed us, is God.</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 20, <hi>But ye have an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction from the holy One, and ye know all things.</hi> Ver. 27, <hi>But the anointing which ye have received of him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth in you; and ye need not that any man ſhould teach you,</hi> [the grounds of Religion which ye have already learned, or any new Doctrines which ye have not already received] <hi>but as the ſame anointing teacheth you of all things</hi> (needful to be known in order to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or to preſerve you from being deceived or drawn away by falſe Teachers) <hi>and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye ſhall abide in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides this anointing common to all Gods people, there is a more ſpecial Unction, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb facs="tcp:43501:10"/> certain perſons choſen and called of God to holy employment eſpecially, are fitted and qualified with gifts and graces for the better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their Office, in former times typified by material Unctions, <hi>Lev. 8. 12, And he poured of the anointing oyl upon Aarons head, and anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to ſanctifie him.</hi> But Chriſt was anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a more large manner and fuller meaſure than any other, being choſen and called and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God to the office of Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and man, which no other was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, or fitted for, <hi>Pſal. 45. 7—therefore God, thy God hath anointed thee with the oyl of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs above thy fellows.</hi> Chriſt had a fulneſs of <hi>abundance,</hi> Col. 2. 3, <hi>In whom are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledg.</hi> Ver. 9, <hi>For in him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily.</hi> And Chriſt had a fulneſs of <hi>redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,</hi> that floweth over unto his people. Like the ointment upon the head of <hi>Aaron,</hi> that ran down to the skirts of his garments, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133. 2; ſo there is a conveyance of grace and ſpiritual gifts from Chriſt unto his members, who is like a fountain, that though it over-flows, yet ever-flows; ſendeth forth its ſtreams, and yet is full ſtill, <hi>Col. 1. 19, For it pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell.</hi> Joh 1. 16, <hi>And of his fulneſs have all we received, and grace for grace.</hi> As from the fulneſs of ſin in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> we have all received ſin for ſin; ſo from the fulneſs of grace in Chriſt the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43501:11"/> ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> all Gods people receive grace for grace.</p>
               <p>Chriſt was thus anointed [<hi>to preach good tidings to the meek</hi>]. When man had ſinned ſad tidings were brought unto him, <hi>curſed is the ground for thy ſake,</hi> tidings of toyl and labour, tidings of death, and of the evils con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the threatning, tidings of wrath and ſore diſpleaſure from a provoked God. Yet God himſelf did preach the firſt tidings of a Saviour to loſt man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. When the Lord ſent a meſſage to <hi>Iſrael</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> that <hi>becauſe they were a ſtiff-necked people, he would come into the midſt of them, and conſume them;</hi> theſe were evil tidings, and cauſe of mourning, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 4. The Prophet was ſent to the Wife of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> with heavy tidings, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14. 6. But when man was in a loſt condition, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of a Saviour were the beſt and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt tidings that could be brought unto him. If God had ſaid to man, <hi>I will make thee rich, but I will not forgive thy ſins; thou ſhalt live long in the world, but not eternally with me in heaven; thou ſhalt live on earth all thy days in eaſe and pleaſure, but after death in pain and torments;</hi> theſe would have been heavy ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. But for God to ſay and ſend to loſt man this news, thou haſt undone thy ſelf, but I will help thee; thou haſt loſt thy ſoul, thy God, thy happineſs, but I will reſtore thee, I will give and ſend my Son to ſeek and to ſave
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43501:11"/> loſt ſinners; was not this joyful tidings? God ſent his Prophets to publiſh theſe tidings to the world, <hi>Iſa</hi> 52. 7. And Apoſtles came with theſe glad tidings, <hi>Act</hi> 13. 32. And Angels, <hi>Luk. 2. 10. The Angel ſaid, fear not, behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which ſhall be to all the people.</hi> But theſe tidings were not only brought by Prophets, Apoſtles, and Angels, but by Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Luk. 8. 1, He went through every Village and City, preaching and ſhewing the glad tidings of the Kingdom of God. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaid of <hi>Ahimaaz, he is a good man, and bringeth good tidings, 2 Sam.</hi> 18. 27. But Chriſt, we may ſay, is a good Saviour, and bringeth good, the beſt tidings that ever were report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the children of men. And when Chriſt returned to heaven, he hath given commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Miniſters to preach and publiſh the ſame tidings. As <hi>Cuſhi</hi> ſaid running in haſte, <hi>tidings my Lord the King, 2 Sam.</hi> 18. 31; ſo we come to poor ſinners, ſaying, <hi>tydings</hi> to you poor periſhing ſinners, <hi>tidings; tidings</hi> from God, <hi>tidings</hi> from heaven. What? what are they? are they glad tidings? may ſinners ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any glad tidings? Tell us, oh tell us, what are theſe tidings that you bring? What are they? <hi>Chriſt a Saviour for loſt ſinners. Chriſt a Phyſitian for ſick and wounded ſinners. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for the guilty ſinner. Peace for the troubled ſinner; Life to the condemned ſinner; Heaven for the Hell-deſerving ſinner. Theſe, theſe</hi> are
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43501:12"/> 
                  <hi>tidings</hi> that are brought unto you! Oh <hi>how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the Goſpel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things, Rom.</hi> 10. 15. But do you bring theſe tidings to great ſinners of a Scarlet dye? Yes, if you do repent, and turn to God, and accept of Chriſt upon Goſpel-terms for Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, here are tidings in the Goſpel brought by Chriſt himſelf of pardon and ſalvation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. But what if we do not, hath Chriſt brought any ſad and heavy tidings; Yes verily, as you may read, <hi>Mark 16. 16, He that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not, ſhall be damned.</hi> It was ſad tidings when news was brought that the <hi>Ark</hi> was loſt, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 19. But oh what heavy tidings will it be to the refuſers of mercy, to the ſlighters of Chriſt and his grace, when it ſhall be told them; Now your Souls are for ever loſt, and God and Chriſt is for ever loſt, and heavens happineſs is for ever loſt. In a word Chriſt came princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to preach good tidings to poor ſinners; but yet he bringeth alſo terrible tidings to the impenitent and unbelieving.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He hath ſent me to bind up the broken-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>]. When man by ſin had broke Covenant with God, he broke the peace with God, and all mankind did break in <hi>Adam,</hi> and proved Bankrupts; and though all are broken by ſin, yet few are broken for ſin; all of us put up <hi>broken duties,</hi> but few of us have <hi>broken hearts;</hi> many are broken in their eſtates through po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43501:12"/> and many mens bodies are broken through age and ſickneſs; but yet their hearts do not break for their ſin. But this is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of broken-hearted ſinners, that Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was ſent to bind you up, to dreſs and to heal your wounded broken hearts. Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions may ſet and bind broken and diſ-joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bones, but Chriſt alone can ſet, and bind, and give eaſe to broken hearts. When by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thou doſt break the commands of God, he is highly offended and provoked, <hi>Num. 15. 30, But the ſoul that doth ought preſumptuouſly,—the ſame reproacheth the Lord; and that ſoul ſhall be cut off from among his people. 31, Becauſe he hath deſpiſed the word of the Lord, and hath broken his Commandment, that ſoul ſhall be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly cut off, his iniquity ſhall be upon him.</hi> But when by ſorrowing and repenting thy heart is broken becauſe thou haſt broken the command of God, he is well-pleaſed with thee, <hi>Pſal. 51. 17, The ſacrifices of God are a broken ſpirit; a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and a contrite heart, O God, thou will not deſpiſe.</hi> When thou didſt break the command of God, thou didſt deſpiſe God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 9. But when thy heart is broken for thy ſin, God will not deſpiſe thy broken-heart, but God himſelf will come and bind and heal thee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 3. He <hi>will come and revive thy contrite ſpirit,</hi> Iſa. 57. 15. <hi>He will come and be nigh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, and will ſave thee, Pſal.</hi> 34. 18. The ſum of all is this, if thou be broken for thy ſins,
<pb facs="tcp:43501:13"/> thou ſhalt not dye of the wounds by ſin made in thy Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound</hi>]. This might partly refer to the temporal deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance by <hi>Cyrus</hi> from the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but chiefly denotes the ſpiritual freedom from the bondage and thraldom of Satan and ſin by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In theſe words you may obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A choice and precious priviledg.</hi> Bondage and thraldom is a ſore evil, liberty as great a good; but the ſpiritual bondage and ſlavery of the Soul to Satan and to ſin, is far worſe than corporal bondage, than <hi>Turkiſh</hi> ſlavery; therefore ſpiritual liberty by Chriſt is far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond (in its excellency and deſirableneſs) any outward deliverance from bodily bondage.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The perſons that this priviledg is for.</hi> For thoſe that are Captives. The bleſſings and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges that ſinners have by Chriſt are ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their neceſſity, reſtoring of ſight to the blind, limbs to the lame, health to the ſick, eaſe to the pained, and liberty to the Captive, are all ſeaſonable and ſuitable mercies.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The publiſhing, declaring, and making of it known,</hi> by way of proclamation. The great God that might have kept ſinners in bonds for ever, and in priſon for ever; doth paſs an act of grace, and ſent his own Son into the world, to proclaim liberty to ſpiritual bond-men; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43501:13"/> hath been made by Chriſt himſelf, that priſoners may be releaſed, that thoſe that are bound in Chains may have their fetters knocked off, and ſuch as have been taken Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by the Devil, the common enemy of mans ſalvation, may be ſet at liberty; and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel are given by Chriſt, and ſent by him as the <hi>Heralds</hi> of the great King of Heaven and Earth, to proclaim pardon to the penitent, healing to the wounded, eaſe to the burdened, liberty to the captives. This Chriſt did in perſon in the days of his fleſh upon earth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 37; and now the Miniſters of Chriſt do proclaim the ſame things in Chriſts ſtead, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 18, 19, 20. Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> put forth a proclamation throughout all his Kingdom, to give free liberty to the Captive <hi>Jews</hi> to go back unto <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to build the Houſe of the Lord, ſaying, <hi>Who is there among you of all his people, the Lord his God be with him, and let him go up, 2 Chron.</hi> 36. 22, 23. So the Lord, the King of Nations, hath made a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, and put it in writing, and commands his Servants to go up and proclaim, <hi>return,</hi> ye ſinners unto me, <hi>and I will not cauſe mine anger to fall upon you, for I am merciful, ſaith the Lord God, and I will not keep anger for ever, Jer.</hi> 3. 12. I might be angry with you, as long as I am God; but if you will repent and turn, I will not. I might pour out my wrath upon you for ever; but if you will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43501:14"/> your wicked ways, <hi>Iniquity ſhall not be your ruin, Ezek. 18. 30, 31. Iſa.</hi> 55. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7. Who is there among you, that are weary of the ſervice of ſin? you might be received into better ſervice, and have a better reward. Who is there among you, that are weary of your Chains and Fetters? be but willing, and you ſhall be freed from them. Who is there among you, that hath lain long in the Gaol of Satan, in the filthy darkſome dungeon of an unconverted ſtate? behold Chriſt is come to open the priſon doors; <hi>Go ye forth, come away,</hi> ſinners, <hi>come away,</hi> not only one by one, which yet would be matter of joy, to ſee one one Lords day, and another on another Lords day to come out of priſon; but ſince the priſon doors are open, and Chriſt is come to knock off your fetters, <hi>come, come away by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; come, come away in numbers;</hi> come, who ſteps out of this priſon firſt? who would not? Methinks, I ſee one, he is loth to come forth; and another he regards it not. What ails you Sirs? Is a priſon delightful? Are bonds plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant? Is a dungeon ſo delicate, that you are loth to leave it? What ails you? ſinner! Art thou thy ſelf, thine own man? Art thou in thy wits? Thou art worſe than mad, that wilt not put off Chains of Iron, for Chains of Gold; that wilt not leave a Priſon for a Palace; thick darkneſs for marvelous, glorious, ſhining light. Do you think, if all the priſon doors in the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43501:14"/> Land were opened, and proclamation made, that whoſoever would, might have free liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to go forth, that any would remain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? Oh, why then are the Devils priſoners, add thoſe that are captives to their luſts, the only perſons that like and love their bondage? that might have deliverance, but will not? But give thy ſelf the labour to hear what ſhall be ſaid of the miſerable condition of theſe Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and afterwards I hope thou wilt be more wiſe for thy ſelf, for thy Soul, than to refuſe ſpiritual freedom, and to chuſe thy Chains and Fetters.</p>

               <p>1. <hi>Doct. UNconverted men are the Devils Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, being faſt bound with the chains and bonds of their own iniquity and ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Preſently after the Creation of man, there was a ſpiritual war, conflict, and combat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt man and the Devil; the place where this war began was Paradiſe, in which ſight the Devil overcame, and did prevail, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt our firſt Parents, but their poſterity alſo; Then was man firſt carried captive and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43501:15"/> taken priſoner by the Devil, and doth remain ſo till he is reſcued, redeemed, and delivered by Jeſus Chriſt the Captain of our ſalvation. Thus wicked men are ſaid to be <hi>taken captive by the Devil at his will, 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 26; and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them in a peaceable, quiet ſubjection to him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 21; and dwelleth, worketh, and ruleth in their hearts, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2. The heart of an unregenerate ſinner, is the Devils garriſon, fort, and ſtrong-hold, where he ſits, and acts, and commands like an uſurping Tyrant; and the poor ſinner yeildeth obedience to him without oppoſition or reſiſtance. Thus are they alſo ſaid to be <hi>bound faſt in the bond of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and ſin, Act.</hi> 8. 23; and are <hi>the ſervants of ſin, and ſlaves to their own corruption and luſts, Rom.</hi> 6. 16; and <hi>ſerve divers luſts, Tit.</hi> 3. 3; and are <hi>the ſervants of corruption,</hi> who being overcome by Satan and by ſin, are brought into bondage by them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
               <p>In theſe particulars following, it will appear that unconverted, graceleſs men are captives and bondmen to Satan and to ſin.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Captives and bondmen are diſarmed;</hi> their weapons and armour of defence are taken from them, that they are not able to make reſiſtance againſt thoſe by whom they are taken captives and priſoners. Sirs, the enemies of your Souls are,</p>

               <p>Poor captivated ſouls! are you thus in the hands of your enemies, and not one piece of ſpiritual armour to ſafe-guard your ſelves? Captives lye at the mercy of thoſe whoſe ſlaves they be; but Satan hath no ſuch thing as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or pity to the ſouls of men; malice enough, but no mercy; cruelty enough, but no favour. If God ſhould have no mercy for you, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil will have none. Except the God of mercy, and pity, and patience had reſtrained the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of your ſouls, they would have dragged you down to the bottomleſs pit long before this day. There is no <hi>armour of proof</hi> againſt thoſe that have taken you captive, but the <hi>armour of God:</hi> but this is your miſery, you have not one piece thereof, neither the girdle of <hi>truth,</hi> nor the breaſt-plate of <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> nor the helmet of <hi>ſalvation;</hi> and though you may have the Sword of the Spirit, the word of God in your hands, yet you know not how to uſe it againſt the aſſaults of your ſpiritual adverſaries. Think then of this, Captives are naked and unarmed men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Captives loſe the riches they had, when ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Captives.</hi> That though they were rich be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet are made poor, and are ſtripped of all. If a rich Merchant at Sea have many goods
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43501:17"/> in a Ship, coſtly Jewels, precious Pearls, and be taken priſoner, and carried captive, he is ſpoiled of all, and loſeth all. Man at firſt was exceeding rich, rich in the knowledg of God, rich in love and likeneſs to God. The holineſs of man was his riches, the enjoyment of God was his riches, the ſpiritual endowments of man at firſt, were not to be valued with the gold of <hi>Ophir,</hi> with the precious <hi>Onyx</hi> or the <hi>Saphire;</hi> Gold and Chriſtal could not equal them, they were not to be exchanged for Jewels of fine Gold, the <hi>Topaz</hi> of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> could not equal them, neither were they to be valued with pure Gold, Coral or Pearls were not worthy to be mentioned with them, for their price was above <hi>Rubies,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> ſetteth forth the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of wiſdom, <hi>Job</hi> 28. 15, to the <hi>20th</hi> verſe. But when man was overcome by the Devil, and taken captive by him, he was ſpoiled of all, all was taken from him, that he became miſerably poor, loſt his knowledg of God, the image of God, the favour of God, communion with God, the gracious comfortable preſence of God, his abode in Paradiſe; and though before he was Lord of all, and had dominion over all inferiour creatures; yet being captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Devil, he loſt his right to all, and was turned out of all. So it is with all unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men, whatever be their outward riches and worldly enjoyments, as to ſpirituals they are miſerably poor, very beggars indeed, <hi>Rev.</hi>

Weep! ſo we do, ſo we have theſe thouſand years, and yet our tears do not put out theſe flames. Oh then <hi>there is no hope, there is no hope;</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:43501:22"/> Oh to think of this there is no hope, ſaith Conſcience, makes me to cry out of thy folly and thy madneſs, that wouldſt be a ſervant and a ſlave unto the Devil and thy fleſh, for which now thou art tormented in theſe flames; thou drunkeſt hard to come unto this place, thou ſwearedſt hard to come unto theſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Oh how didſt thou labour to undo thy ſelf! How didſt thou daily work in the ſervice of the Devil, and thy luſts! and thou art thus rewarded for thy pains. Now thou <hi>feelest</hi> what Miniſters did often tell thee; now thou <hi>findeſt</hi> what God did declare, that the wages of ſin is death. Sin was thy work, Hell is thy wages. <hi>This this</hi> is the fruit of thy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; this is the place of miſery which the Devil and thy Sin hath led thee captive to; and while thou and I live (ſaith Conſcience) I muſt be putting thee in remembrance, that thy ſin, and thy own doings have brought thee to this place. Thus you ſee what hard wages theſe Captives will receive for all the ſervice (as the Devils bond-ſlaves they do here) remaining captives to him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Captives and bond-ſlaves have not the priviledges and the immunities that of right do belong to free-men.</hi> Many, great, and precious are the priviledges of Gods redeemed people, purchaſed by the blood of Chriſt, but thoſe that are yet in Spiritual bondage, ſervants of Sin, are not partakers of them; if ever God
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43501:22"/> give Spiritual priviledges, pardon of Sin, peace with God, well-grounded peace of Conſcience, he will make you free, and bring you out of the houſe of bondage, before he put you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the poſſeſſion of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Free Citizens have ſome advantages that thoſe that are not free, have not, which if they would enjoy they muſt buy their freedom; Spiritual free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is purchaſed indeed by Chriſt, but freely beſtowed upon thoſe that are made free, and then, and not till then, are the priviledges of redeemed perſons conferred upon them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Captives and bond-ſlaves cannot ſatisfie the greedy deſires of their cruel exactors;</hi> though they work hard, and toil much, yet they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think they do enough, but are ready to impoſe double tasks ſtill upon them. When the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage had their task much increaſed, and complained unto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he replied, <hi>Ye are idle, ye are idle, go ye therefore now and work,</hi> Exod. 5. 17, 18. Spiritual captives in their bondage take much pains in the ſervice of Satan and Sin, yet theſe Task-maſters never think that they ſin enough, or that they do diſhonour God enough, though they ſin with greedineſs, yet the Devil would have them to be more vile ſtill, and to be more wicked ſtill; to ſwear more, and to hate God and his people, and his ways yet more. It is true, the Redeemed of the Lord, never do ſo much but they ought
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43501:23"/> ſtill to do more, to love God <hi>more and more,</hi> and to delight in God, and deſire after God ſtill <hi>more and more;</hi> but the difference is great, their work is good, and the more the better, but the works of the Devils bondmen are evil, and the more the worſe: and this helliſh Impoſer will not be ſatisfied with all the wickedneſs thou doſt commit, but will provoke thee ſtill, and tempt thee ſtill, that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſink thee lower, and be plagued more in helliſh torments in the life to come.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Captives and bondſlaves are fettered and bound in chains at the pleaſure of thoſe whoſe captives they be.</hi> When <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Babylon</hi> took <hi>Zedekiah</hi> King of <hi>Judah, he bound him in chains, and put him in priſon till the day of his death,</hi> Jer. 52. 11.

               </argument>
               <p>OF the firſt. 1. <hi>The captives and bond-ſlaves of Satan are bound with the Chain of Ignorance;</hi> As the <hi>Syrians</hi> were ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with Blindneſs, thought they were going after their Leader to <hi>Dothan,</hi> but he brought them into the midſt of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and then their eyes were opened, they ſaw they were in <hi>Samaria,</hi> in the midſt of their enemies, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6. 18, 19, 20. You may lead a blind man which way you will; theſe Captives are blind, and except God open their eyes they will not ſee their miſery till they be in the midſt of Hell; they think they are going to Heaven while they live, but after death when the eyes of their bodies are ſhut, the eyes of their ſouls ſhall be opened, and behold they ſee themſelves in the midſt of Hell, among Devils and Damned Spirits. When the <hi>King of Babylon</hi> took <hi>Zedekiah</hi> captive he put out his eyes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 52. 11. and when the <hi>Philistines</hi> did take <hi>Samſon</hi> captive they put out his eyes, <hi>Judg.</hi> 16. 21. and when Satan ſet upon our firſt Parents, and overcame them, their
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43501:24"/> eyes were put out, I mean, of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, they loſt their knowledg of God, and of the way to eternal Happineſs; and all his Children to this day are <hi>born Spiritually blind,</hi> and have their <hi>understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of the heart,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 18. <hi>In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not, lest the light of the glorious Goſpel of Christ, who is the Image of God, ſhould ſhine into them,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 4. and this is one of the firſt Chains which God knocketh off, when he comes to ſet a poor Captive at liberty, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18. But this chain or cord with which they are bound is four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, and ſo not eaſily broken, no, not at all but by Almighty power.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Theſe Captives are bound with the chain of <hi>Ignorance of ſin.</hi> The Devil keeps from the eyes of his bond-ſlaves the evil of Sin, that they ſhould not ſee it in its own nature, in its proper deformity and evil ſhape; for Sin is ſuch a monſter, that if men did ſee it as it is, they would abhor it, for evil <hi>as</hi> evil is not deſirable; but Satan ſets it out in the paint and dreſs of pleaſure or profit, and ſo Sinners are the faſter held thereby; this way he brought Mankind into bondage, and took them captive at the firſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 4, 5, 6. and by this means he keeps them ſtill in ſlavery and captivity.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:43501:24"/>2. They are bound with the chain of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of their miſery and danger by reaſon of ſin.</hi> Theſe captivated Souls are in danger of Gods eternal wrath and curſe, and do not fear it, becauſe they do not ſee it; in danger of eternal torments and do not tremble at it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is hid from their eyes; they ſee not the evil in ſin, and conſider not the evil <hi>after</hi> ſin, but think themſelves to be ſafe, though there is but a ſingle thread of a frail life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and the miſeries of the Damned. When ſinners eyes are opened to diſcern their dangerous condition, the conſcience awakened, they cry out, as they <hi>Act. 2. 37. Men and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren what ſhall we do?</hi> I ſee I am loſt, tell me, Oh tell me, what ſhall I do? I am in danger of the torments of the damned, if you can, for Gods ſake tell me, if you have any love or pity to a poor periſhing Soul, tell me, what ſhall I do? if you know of any way or means for me to eſcape that Hell I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, tell me; is there pardon for ſuch ſins as mine? is there any hope for ſuch a ſinner as I have been, and as yet I am? my time is ſhort, my days are few, and I now do ſee I am as near to Hell, as to the Grave; Oh what ſhall I do that I may eſcape ſo great damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! So the Jaylor, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 30, 31. but while ſinners are ignorant of their miſery and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Satan hath them faſt bound.</p>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43501:25"/> of the remedy to eſcape this miſery and danger that their ſouls are in.</hi> Chriſt is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Saviour of loſt Sinners, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 12. Ignorance of Chriſt is a ſtrong bond to hold men in their ſtate of bondage. Some are <hi>groſly</hi> ignorant of Chriſt, they know not who he was, nor what he did, nor what he did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, ignorant of his Natures, and ignorant of his Offices, ignorant of his Satisfaction, and of his Interceſſion; how ſhould theſe get out of bondage that cannot (while thus ignorant) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him that is the only Redeemer of ſuch captives? And how ſhould they believe on him whom they have no knowledg of? others might have ſome <hi>notional</hi> knowledg of Chriſt the only Redeemer, that they may be able to talk of Chriſt, and of his ſufferings, and of his undertakings for Sinners, that yet have not any ſaving knowledg of him, that do not experimentally know the power of his Death, and the power of his Reſurrection; as one might have ſome knowledg by <hi>hear-ſay</hi> of a man, that they have no acquaintance with, but are utter ſtrangers to; if you ſee your ſin, and if you ſee your miſery by ſin, yet if you do not ſee the Redeemer, have no knowledg of him, you are captive ſtill, and faſt bound in the Devils fetters.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They are bound in the chains of <hi>Ignorance of the Covenant of Grace, that was framed on purpoſe for the relief of captive ſinners;</hi> they
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43501:25"/> know not the terms and conditions of the New Covenant, how Chriſt and his benefits purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by his Death, are to be applied and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed over unto them. Faith in Chriſt is a rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle to them; and while they remain ignorant of the way, means, and conditions propoſed in the Goſpel, how they ſhould be partakers of Redemption purchaſed by Chriſt, they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in a ſtate of bondage and captivity; for the breaking of this cord conſider (1) the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Spiritual knowledg, no Salvation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, <hi>Iſa. 27. 11. 2 Theſ.</hi> 1. 7, 8.

Do but bring forth the grounds and reaſons of your rejoycing, and ſet them over againſt the reaſons of the righteous mans joy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then judg which of the two are more weighty and more rational. Doſt thou lead a merry life becauſe thou doſt enjoy the world? and might not a godly man much more that doth enjoy God himſelf? Art thou ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in thy life, becauſe thou haſt this worlds delights? and might not a godly man much more that hath Heavenly delights? <hi>Methinks</hi> the thoughts of what thou wanteſt, ſhould daſh all the joy thou takeſt in what thou haſt. Thou
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43501:29"/> haſt Riches, but thou wanteſt Grace; thou haſt the favour of thy friends, but thou haſt not the favour of the great eternal God; thou haſt no debts to pay, or none but what thou canſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, but thou haſt not the pardon of thy ſin, this debt remains uncroſſed in the Book of God, and thou art never able to diſcharge this debt. <hi>Methinks</hi> the thoughts and fears of what thou ſhalt hereafter feel ſhould damp thy joy, and in thy greateſt merry mood ſhould check thy folly and change thy countenance, and fill thy heart with ſorrow and ſadneſs; what! thou be merry when thou art ſo near to Hell? what! upon the very brink and border of the bottomleſs pit? what! when thou maiſt not be out of Hell a year or two, nay, not a month or two, nay not a day or two; nay, when it is more than thou canſt tell, whether thou ſhalt be out of Hell an hour or two? <hi>Is this</hi> the man, that is ſo merry? <hi>Is this</hi> the man that pleads ſo much for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delight? <hi>Is this the man indeed</hi> that would ſpend his preſent time in joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?

               <p>What think you all ye that hear me this day, that know and underſtand the dreadful danger of a graceleſs, chriſtleſs, unconverted ſinner? can you ſee him ſporting with delight about the brink of Hell, and not fear and tremble, leaſt ye ſee him falling down into it? Can you ſee

Do not your hearts pity ſuch a one, though he hath no pity for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? Come ſinner, judg thy ſelf, if of all men in the world thou haſt any cauſe of ſuch a joyful life thou pleadeſt for; and whether if thou wouldeſt lead a chearful life <hi>indeed,</hi> it would not be thy <hi>wiſer, ſurer, ſafer</hi> courſe to leave thy ſerving of the Devil and thy luſts, and to break thy cords and chains wherewith thou haſt been bound, and held captive ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years as thou haſt been.</p>
               <p>Beſides, what are theſe pleaſures which thou findeſt in the Creature? What are theſe joys and comforts which thou fetcheſt from any thing beſides God, or below God? are they not ſenſual and bruitiſh? are they not only found in the ſenſitive part of thy Soul, and not in the more noble and rational part? Doſt thou place thy pleaſure and delights in eating and drinking, and gratifying thy ſenſitive ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite; why thy very beaſt, thy horſe, thy dog, hath this delight as well as thou? and ſome creatures more than man. I can tell thee of a man that hath tried more than what theſe pleaſures are; that had a greater eſtate, and greater varieties of all ſorts to delight himſelf, that hath made ſuch ſearch what there is in all things under the Sun to delight the heart of man, that no man that comes after him can do
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43501:30"/> more; and yet he hath left it upon record from his own experience, <hi>that all is vanity and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of ſpirit,</hi> and that is <hi>Solomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 2. throughout; take thy Book and read it; his Concluſion is, that the delights and pleaſures fetcht from things above the Sun do far ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs and exceed all pleaſures and delight taken from all things under the Sun; the ſame man that tells thee, all under the Sun is vanity, doth alſo tell thee that the ways of wiſdom, <hi>are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace,</hi> Pro. 3. 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Come then,</hi> poor captive Sinners, <hi>come and try</hi> what comforts and delights are to be found in the ways and ſervice of our God. Do not judg before you try; how can <hi>you</hi> tell, what are the ways of God, before you have made experience what they be? How can <hi>you</hi> tell, there are no comforts, joys that the Saints meet with, when you were never qualified for thoſe comforts and thoſe joys? I do not perſwade you to caſt away a comfortable life, but to change it for a better; I do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to leave delights and pleaſures, but to change them for more <hi>noble,</hi> more <hi>rational,</hi> more <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> more <hi>durable</hi> delights: Come and get a real taſte and reliſh of the ſweet delights in <hi>communion with God,</hi> in <hi>the ſenſe of his love, in a right applying of his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in hoping for his Kingdom;</hi> and if you do not like them better, and find them ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then return again to your preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43501:30"/> and fetch them again from the ſame Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that now you do; but then be ſure your heart be changed, that you might taſte indeed the ſweetneſs of delights and comforts in God, in Chriſt, in the promiſes and priviledges of the Goſpel and I dare be bold to ſay, you will then ſay theſe are <hi>better, greater, ſweeter</hi> than ever any before you found in Satans ſervice, or in the way of Sin: Come therefore, come and try.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>What needs that? though we have not tried our ſelves, yet we ſee how it is by thoſe that have? do not we ſee that thoſe that have forſaken their former ways, and ſince have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more preciſe and ſtrict, that they ſpend their days in ſorrow? are always mourning and complaining; their tears and countenances ſhew the heavineſs and ſadneſs, and ſorrow of their hearts.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>You do not know how ſweet and pleaſant, and delightful theſe bitter tears of Repentance are unto them that ſhed moſt of them;</hi> It is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding comfortable to have an heart to mourn and grieve kindly for their ſins; their tears thou ſeeſt, but their inward peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that often follows after theſe, thou takeſt no notice of.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>But how dost thou know the true cauſe and reaſon of their ſorrow?</hi> Thou art apt to impute it to the way that they walk in; did ever any truly godly Soul, that leads the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and moſt ſorrowful life, tell thee, his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is, becauſe <hi>now</hi> he is become an holy man; did ever any tell thee, it is becauſe they have left their former wicked ways? and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are become new creatures, and have given up their names, their wills, their hearts, and all to God, and Chriſt? if this, and no
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43501:31"/> ſuch like thing be the cauſe of their ſadneſs, is there any reaſon thou ſhouldeſt thus be prejudiced againſt the ſtate of the Lords Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed ones, and pleaſe thy ſelf rather in this preſent bonds, than to deſire to be relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and delivered from them? But what if theſe tears thou ſeeſt them ſhed, and the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row thou doſt perceive they are filled with, be</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>they were captives to the Devil ſo long, and ſerved ſin and lust ſo long,</hi> that they lay in chains and fetters ſo long, when a Redeemer was ſo often offered to them, and they had not hearts to cloſe with him ſooner than they did; that they ſerved the Devil, an hard cruel maſter ſo long, and came into Chriſt, ſo good and ſo gracious a Lord, as by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience now they find him to be, and his work and wages to be ſo ſweet, that they came to him ſo late; if this be the true reaſon, is their ſorrow than any real reaſon of your prejudice againſt godlineſs? no verily, it doth commend it ſo much the more.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What if the reaſon of their ſorrow be becauſe <hi>they have made no more progreſs in holineſs ſince they came into the ways of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</hi> that they have attained no more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto God, to no more faith and love, to no more humility and heavenly-mindedneſs; they are weeping and mourning as <hi>you ſee,</hi> not becauſe they are come into the ways of God, as <hi>you do think,</hi> but becauſe they have
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43501:32"/> gone yet no further in them; not becauſe they have left their ſin, but becauſe they did ſin ſo much, and now can leave their ſin no more; they are ſo ſorrowful becauſe they are no more fruitful, becauſe they are no better; ask them if this be not the reaſon? and if ſo, is there any reaſon their ſorrow ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice your hearts againſt godlineſs? no verily, it doth commend it ſo much the more, when they that have a true and real taſte of the ſweetneſs of it, ſorrow ſo much becauſe they have attained to no more degrees thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What if the reaſon of their ſorrow be, becauſe <hi>they can do no more for God and Chriſt, by way of thankefulneſs to him, who hath done ſo much for them as of bond-ſlaves to make them free?</hi> that God ſhould give his own on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Son, and Chriſt ſhould give himſelf, his life, his ſoul, his blood for a ranſome to bring them out of their captivity; to deliver them from hell and wrath to come and make them that were <hi>the other day</hi> in bondage, and liable to damnation, <hi>now</hi> meet to be partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in light; and yet that they can honour him no more, might be the reaſon of their ſorrow.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What if the reaſon of their ſorrow be, becauſe <hi>they ſee ſo many ſtill remain in bonds,</hi> ſo many ſtill continue ſervants to the Devil, and to ſin, and do refuſe to ſerve and live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bleſſed, holy, glorious God? and is not
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43501:32"/> this matter of ſorrow indeed to ſee the Devil leading precious and immortal Souls captive unto hell? that men ſhould be ſo forward to follow the Devil, their <hi>deſtroyer</hi> unto eternal torments, and ſo backward to follow Chriſt, the only <hi>Saviour</hi> unto eternal joys? theſe are mourning, not that they are made free, but becauſe you and ſo many more remain cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to the Devil.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>What though the reaſon of their ſorrow be for their ſin which they did commit when they were bond-ſlaves to the Devil,</hi> doth this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend holineſs, to bewail wickedneſs, or is this for the credit and the commendation of your ſinful way of life, that men that are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and have their eyes opened, do ſee ſo much evil in it, that they think they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lament it enough? certainly it doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace the way of ſin.</p>

I tell thee, it will be the hardeſt task that ever thou waſt put upon, to bear the torments of the damned.

God is not an hard Maſter to his ſervants, to put them upon work, and give them neither power nor reward, for he gives both to thoſe that in ſincerity give up themſelves unto his ſervice.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:43501:42"/> upon earth to do, or for any Angel in Heaven to do; Sinners are ſo faſt locked in their fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that it requires Almighty power to break them that the captive may eſcape and be ſet at liberty; Oh that therefore God would come, and burſt and break it quite aſunder! Oh that God would come and take it off, were it but from one or two amongſt you this day! that though you came captives in your chain, yet you might go home free-men, and at liberty; <hi>but yet</hi> ſomething is required from you, that you ſhould conſider and weigh with your ſelves impartially and deliberately what hath been ſaid, to remove this prejudice of your hearts, which makes you like your preſent captive-ſtate, and not deſirous to come forth from it; and if what hath been ſpoken is not ſufficient ground to ſilence theſe carnal pleas, I beg the prayers of the Congregation for me, that God would forgive my weakneſs, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my unskilfulneſs, that know no better how to deliver a meſſage from the Lord, and to pray that for the future I might be more fitted for this weighty work; but if there be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of truth in what hath been delivered and ſpoken in your ears, I charge you <hi>in the name of the dreadful and eternal God, in the name of Chriſt my Lord that ſent me,</hi> that you do not ſlight it; if I have ſpoken my own words, fling them back in my face, and tell me that I lie; but if it be according to the

               <p>3. A Third Chain wherewith theſe Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are bound is <hi>the immoderate and prevailing love of the profits and riches of this world:</hi> This bindeth thouſands faſt that they will not, cannot ſtir or move, or come to Chriſt, that they may be ſet at liberty; theſe are bound with <hi>chains of gold;</hi> and becauſe they are golden chains, therefore they like them ſo much the more; the Devil doth not care for coſt, if by all he can keep you ſtill in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; he will not grudg you the <hi>riches</hi> of <hi>the world,</hi> if he can keep you <hi>out of heaven.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moral men that have eſcaped the groſs pollutions of the world, that are no Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, nor Drunkards, nor openly profane, that bleſs themſelves with the thoughts of their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed good condition, yet are as ſure the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils priſoners,</hi> and in ſlavery and bondage, and ſhall as certainly periſh and be damned (except they get this bond broken) as any Drunkard in the Town, or Pariſh where they live. Believe this as a certain truth, for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it; turn and read <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 5. Shall not the Whoremonger be ſaved, nor the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> monger neither? Shall not the unclean
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43501:43"/> perſon inherit the Kingdom of God, no nor the perſon that hath his heart and affections ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the world? And the Holy Ghoſt gives a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe ſuch a man is <hi>an Idolater,</hi> making his Gold his god; that love and delight, and joy which God ſhould have is given to the world, and that God will never bear; that hope and truſt which ſhould be placed in the living God, is placed in uncertain riches, and this the jealous God will never brook. Turn again to <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5, 6. God tells you this over and over, in one place after another, that ſo you might the more beware of being kept in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage by this golden chain, which is ſo very ſtrong that the Lord doth tell us, <hi>the love of money is the root of all evil,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 10. There are many branches of ſin which ſhoot out in the lives of men, but all do grow upon this root, the heart being fixed in its love unto the world.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Omiſſions of duty,</hi> neglect of Cloſet and Family-prayer, worldlineſs is the root, the heart is ſo eager after riches, that they have no time, nor leiſure for better things; and when they have time, yet the worldly heart is indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to perform them, and is liſtleſs to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly employment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Commiſſions of ſin,</hi> the uſe of falſe balan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and deceitful meaſures, over-reaching, breach of promiſes, falſifying their words, ſpeaking often againſt Conſcience; the Seller
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43501:44"/> commending his goods beyond, and above what he knows them to be, affirming they coſt them more than they did, and if he ſells them not for ſo much, he ſhall be a loſer by them, and all this to ſcrew the buyer to an higher price; and the Buyer diſcommends the Sellers ware, ſaying, it is naught, it is naught; to bring him down to a lower rate, but all this cometh from this evil bitter root, the <hi>immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate love of the world.</hi> Many men engage in company and are over-taken with exceſſive drinking, and when reproved, will reply, It was with ſuch as were my Cuſtomers, and I cannot avoid ſuch occaſions, if I will not drink with ſome, they will not trade with me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept I go to the Ale-houſe, or the Tavern, I ſhall loſe the taking of many a pound. Shall you ſo? yes, and <hi>would prevent many a drunken bout.</hi> But what have you houſes of your own for, and what are your Shops for, and what is the Exchange for, but for your trades and dealing in the world. It is a ſhame, that it is brought into ſo great a cuſtom, <hi>that many cannot buy and ſell but over a pot.</hi> But if you do go, what need you drink unto exceſs? do others urge thee? but they cannot, they do not <hi>force</hi> thee, is it not thine own hand that often lift<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the glaſs unto thy mouth? and is not thy hand commanded by thy own will to do it? thou hadſt better be without ſuch a Cuſtomer, and without the profit thou gaineſt by him,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:43501:44"/> than to ſin, and wound, and loſe thy Soul. But this branch of wickedneſs groweth on this cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed root, the love of Money, which if ſome may gain, they will go from one drinking-place into another, from morning to night, one day after another; yes, and to Hell too at the laſt, if they might but gain, what their heart doth ſo much love while they are here. By this bond was <hi>Balaam</hi> bound, <hi>who loved the wages of unrighteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 15. And <hi>Achan, Joſh.</hi> 7. 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 21. And <hi>Gehazi,</hi> who framed fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoods, for worldly profit, and afterwards would have hid it from his Maſter with a lie, 2 <hi>King. 5. 20. to the end.</hi> And the <hi>young man, Mat.</hi> 19. 21, 22. whom, when Chriſt ſaw ſo faſt fettered with this chain, he preached to his Diſciples, that it was exceeding hard for a rich man to be ſaved; though he explained, that it is not ſo much the having, as the over-loving of them, and truſting in them that hinders mens Salvation, <hi>Mar. 10. 24. Judas</hi> alſo was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Devils captive, being bound with this bond, who for the love of Money ſold his Lord, and Soul and all, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 14, 15, 16. And <hi>Demas,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 10. And doubtleſs thouſands are now in everlaſting chains of darkneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept in bondage by the love of the world, while they lived in the world. But ſhall we try to break this bond, for till your hearts be weaned from the world, we ſhall not win them for Jeſus Chriſt, for you cannot love God and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:43501:45"/> the world too with a prevailing and predomi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nant love, 1 <hi>Joh. 2. 15. Jam.</hi> 4. 4. and while you love the world you cannot value Chriſt, nor are you worthy of him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 37, 38. Conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Have you not other things and better things to ſet the love of your hearts upon?</hi> and is there not a God and Chriſt for thee to love? And (1) is not God infinitely a more noble, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent object for thy love? (2) Is he not a more ſuitable good unto thy Soul? (3) Is he not a ſufficient good? and therefore (4) a ſatisfying good? (5) Is he not a more neceſſary good, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without the things of the world thou maiſt be happy, but not without God? (6) Is he not a more durable, laſting everlaſting good? do but get a right knowledg of God and the world, and then thou wilt ſee cauſe to call off thy heart from earthly things, and ſet them upon God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Shouldſt thou ſet thy heart and love upon earthly things which thou must ſhortly leave, and canſt not carry with thee into another world?</hi> Doſt thou forget that thou art a pilgrim upon earth, and that this is not the place of thy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode? after thou haſt ſlept out a few more nights, and walked up and down a few more days, will not thy laſt hour come, when thou muſt bid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieu to all this world, and take thy farewell of all upon earth? whether thou ſhalt go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or to Hell, here thou muſt not tarry; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:43501:45"/> thou ſhalt be damned or ſaved, or go to God or Devils, here thou muſt not abide; and wilt thou take thy riches with thee? what to do, Silver and Gold doth not go in another world. Whether thou goeſt to Heaven or to Hell after death, Riches will be of no uſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee; <hi>God</hi> would then ſtand by thee, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> would then ſtand by thee, and <hi>Grace</hi> would then go with thee, but thou muſt leave thy worldly riches, and they will then leave thee, when thou ſtandeſt in greateſt need of comfort and ſupport, <hi>Luc. 12. 19, 20. Pſal. 49. 17. Eccleſ. 5. 15. 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 7. Why wilt thou then ſo fix thy heart upon theſe things, and be fettered and intangled with the love of them as thereby to be kept from God, and Chriſt, and Heaven for ever.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Can theſe things comfort thee at thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture?</hi> Or will it not then wound thy Soul that thou haſt loved the world, but not God and Chriſt? didſt thou never ſtand by the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of a dying man, who in the anguiſh of his Soul hath roared and cried out, <hi>Wo is me, that I have ſpent my time in labouring for the world, for this vain and empty world, While God and Chriſt, and Heaven have been neglected by me! Oh if I had loved God and Chriſt, as I have loved the world, I had been now an happy, bleſſed man, though I am a dying man, yet I had been now an happy bleſſed man. God would now have comforted me, and Christ
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:43501:46"/> would now have comforted me, and ſolid lively hopes of Heaven would now have comforted me, but the things that had my heart, and all my love, they do not comfort, I find, I feel they do not comfort me.</hi> Shalt thou neither ſtay to enjoy them here, and canſt thou not take them with thee whether thou art going, nor yet will they comfort thee in thy paſſage to Eternity, and is it reaſonable then thou ſhouldſt be thus fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and bound in thy love unto them, as to keep thee from God and Chriſt, here and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after too?</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Was this the end for which thou waſt born, and did God give thee ſuch affections as love de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and delight, that thou ſhouldſt ſet them upon ſuch things as theſe?</hi> Did God make theſe things to be the chiefeſt object of thy Souls affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or thy Souls affections for theſe things? Did God ſend thee into this world to ſcrape together an heap of <hi>refined earth,</hi> and then to love it when thou haſt done, better than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that made thee? Is not this a ſetting God below the creature, and exalting the creature in the room of God? is not this to loſe the end of thy Creation?</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Is not this to love ſuch things as do not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not love thee back again?</hi> If God had thy heart, thou ſhouldſt have his; if thou loveſt him, he would love thee, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 17. but Silver and Gold cannot love thee, thy rich Furniture can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not love thee; here thy love is loſt, and cannot

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43501:48"/> to this place of torment? were you not told <hi>by Miniſters, and by God himſelf,</hi> that you were in the way to miſery and damnation? what would they reply? <hi>Yes, yes, we were often told, and we were plainly told, but this was it that did undo us, we hoped it would be better with us.</hi> Shall I then attempt to break this bond aſunder? but becauſe man can but ſhew unto you the vanity of your hopes, Oh that God himſelf would come and powerfully convince you by his Word and Spirit, that your hopes are vain and groundleſs hopes, that you may be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger kept in thraldom by the Devil by theſe fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of falſe hopes of Heaven. I know that this is a <hi>manifold twiſted cord;</hi> many things there are that you do bottom theſe hopes upon; but if I ſhall ſhew you from the Word of God, that they are no better grounds and reaſons of hope, than graceleſs perſons might alledg, and many <hi>now in hell</hi> once had to ſay, and did, as well as you, that then you will no longer ſuffer Satan to delude and to deceive you, and keep you as his captives in a ſtate of bondage. Only let me ask you firſt, whether you will believe that <hi>that</hi> is true, that God ſpeaketh in his Word, or will you dare to ſay, that what is contained in the Scripture is forgery and a lie; if you ſay the latter, <hi>God</hi> ſhall ſhortly convince you of the truth thereof; the <hi>flames of Hell</hi> ſhall ſhortly convince you, and the <hi>pains and torments</hi> you ſhall ſhortly feel ſhall powerfully convince you,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43501:48"/> that all theſe ſayings of God are true: If you ſay the former, that Gods word is true, I do not doubt to make it appear, that your hope is falſe, if you do agree to try your hopes by the word of God, by which <hi>you and I and all</hi> muſt be ſhortly tried, and acquitted or condemned according to this Word, I do not doubt to ſhew that Satan hath befooled you all this while; God hath as plainly told you, that in an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſtate, <hi>without faith in Chriſt, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and reformation</hi> you cannot be ſaved, this is as plain as can be ſpoken, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Gods revealed will, will you hope you ſhall be ſaved? which do you think ſhall be proved falſe, <hi>Gods word or your hope,</hi> that is contrary to his word? both cannot be true. Will a Drunkard ſay, Gods word is falſe; no, he will not, then thy hope is falſe. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10. Where God doth plainly ſay, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively lay down for a certain truth, and which within a few <hi>years,</hi> or <hi>months,</hi> or <hi>weeks,</hi> all the Drunkards, Whoremongers, and graceleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the world without exception of any one (dying ſo) ſhall find to be ſo, that they ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God. <hi>Come then,</hi> you that ſay, you hope to be ſaved, as well as the preciſeſt of you all <hi>come</hi> and produce your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and in the fear of God ſeriouſly weigh the anſwers that ſhall be given to them.</p>
               <p>1. One Link in this Chain of falſe hopes by
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43501:49"/> which theſe Captives are bound, <hi>is miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion and miſapplication of the mercy of God;</hi> thou ſayeſt, <hi>God is a merciful God, and is ready to ſhew mercy to his creature; it is true in me, there is no merit, but in God there is mercy, and God did not make his creatures to damn them, God did make me, and therefore I hope that he will ſave me.</hi> Is this all thou haſt to ſay, in ſuch a weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty matter? why thou thinkeſt thou art redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from thy bondage, and ſhall be free for ever from the torments of the Damned? that thou maiſt be no longer bound with this Chain. Conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Devils themſelves and the damned ſouls in Hell themſelves can ſay as much as this:</hi> Poor damned <hi>Devils</hi> do know that God is a merciful God, and that he is willing to ſhew mercy to the penitent and the humble ſinner. <hi>Devils</hi> and <hi>damned ſouls</hi> can ſay, that they are Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and yet notwithſtanding they are miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and muſt be ſo for ever; and this is the aggravation of their miſery, that though God is merciful, yet they are for ever damned; this cuts them to the heart, that a merciful God hath condemned them, and ſentenced them down to eternal torments; what is that to them, that God is merciful in himſelf, and ſhews mercy unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; if he is not merciful unto them? and <hi>what is it unto thee,</hi> that God is ſo, if thou by reaſon of thy continuance in a ſtate of unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy, ſhalt never be benefited by his mercy? I
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43501:49"/> know there is a difference betwixt the damned in Hell, and wicked men on Earth: the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Hell are paſt a poſſibility of mercy, but ſo are not you; they ſhall have no more tenders of mercy, which you yet have, but then you muſt repent and be converted, which they were not, or elſe you ſhall have no ſaving benefit by Gods mercy, as they had not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>God might be infinite in mercy, though thou</hi> (and thouſands ſuch as thou art) <hi>do periſh in thy bondage, and be for ever damned.</hi> What a proud blaſphemous thought is this that God ſhould not be merciful, except he take thee <hi>reaking</hi> in thy ſins, except he take thee off thy <hi>Ale-houſe-bench,</hi> and put thee into Heaven. The greatneſs of Gods mercy is not manifeſted ſo much by the <hi>number</hi> of the perſons that ſhall be ſaved, as by the <hi>way and method</hi> which he ſaveth them by. If God had ſaved but <hi>one man</hi> out of all the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny millions of mankind, without his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, and contrary to it, by the death of his own Son, it would have been a plain demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mercy of God. Muſt thou meaſure the mercy of God by thy being ſaved, or not ſaved, while thou walkeſt contrary to his Laws, and to his revealed Will? This is, as if a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor</hi> that for murder hath deſerved death, and is to be tried for his Life, yet hopes he ſhall eſcape, becauſe the Judg is a <hi>merciful man,</hi> when notwithſtanding the Judg proceedeth to paſs a ſentence of death upon him, you will all
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:43501:50"/> acknowledg he might be a very merciful man; and that the Priſoner was a fool, from the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Judg to be confident he ſhould eſcape the execution due unto him for the violation of the Law. So it is in this caſe, which is eaſie to apply.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>God is juſt and true, as well as merciful and gracious,</hi> and why maiſt thou not <hi>fear</hi> that God will damn thee, becauſe he is a juſt God, as well as <hi>hope</hi> that he will ſave thee becauſe he is a merciful God? You do not conceive of God aright, when you conſider him to be merciful without juſtice, and to be gracious without truth, there are both in God. This merciful God hath ſaid, Except you repent and turn from ſin, you ſhall find no mercy from him; and what ſhall become of Gods Truth, if contrary to his Word he ſhould ſave thee without repentance, and while thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt on in thy ſinful ways? muſt God falſifie his word to ſave thy Soul, <hi>never hope for it, for he will never do it.</hi> Where God proclaims his mercy to the penitent, he doth alſo declare his juſtice, and his jealouſie, and his fixed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution that the guilty ſhall not go free, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 6, 7. and that he is full of fury to the wicked, as of mercy to the godly; and that as he reſerveth a Crown for the one, ſo alſo wrath for the other, <hi>Nahum</hi> 1. 2, 3.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Though God be merciful, yet he propoundeth

When thou ſhalt come to put in thy claim for mercy, Lord have mercy on me, for thou art a gracious God; yes may God ſay, and ſo I am, and thoſe that have repented and believed ſhall find me to be ſo, but did I not alſo tell thee what manner of perſon thou ſhouldſt have been, holy, humble and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if thou wouldſt be ſaved by my mercy, but that thou wouldſt not be: therefore <hi>now</hi> I have no mercy for thee. God may ſay unto thee, did I ever promiſe thee or any other, that I would ſave thee, or them without repentance and faith in Chriſt my Son? did I ever promiſe that I would pardon the Impenitent? that I would ſave the unbelieving that finally perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere therein? If I have, produce my words, alledge my promiſe, <hi>when, and where, and by whom</hi> did I ever make thee ſuch a promiſe? and and if I have not, as indeed I have not promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed any ſuch thing, why waſt thou ſo vainly confident of my mercy? therefore <hi>take thy anſwer and be gone?</hi> for I tell thee I will have no mercy on thee. <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 25, 26, 27. Mercy it ſelf will not ſave thee, but in the way of mercy propounded in the Goſpel.</p>

The whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger whom thou thy ſelf wilt condemn might plead this as well as thou; and ſo thou wilt make the way to Heaven broader than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver God did make it. Moreover, if thou hadſt continued ſuch a one as God did make, he would then have made thee happy indeed for ever. God made thee holy and upright, but thou haſt rebelled againſt him: God did make thee a <hi>Creature,</hi> but he did not make thee a <hi>Drunkard;</hi> he did not make thee a <hi>Worldling,</hi> nor a <hi>Lyar,</hi> therefore let Gods creature be holy, and God will not damn his creature; but if thou be a drunkard, or an hypocrite, and God ſhall damn the <hi>drunkard or the hypocrite,</hi> what will become of <hi>Gods creature.</hi> God doth pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily anſwer this, and I will give it thee in his own words. Iſa. 27. 11.—<hi>It is a people of no underſtanding; therefore he that made them, will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them, will ſhew them no favour.</hi> Is not this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to the reaſon of thy hope? wilt thou then plead this no more, while thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueſt in thy ſin, and let not Satan keep thee bound with this cord any longer? if thou doſt, remember it hath been told thee, that this is but a ſandy foundation of thy hope, that thou ſhalt have the everlaſting mercy that ſhall be ſhown to Gods redeemed ones, that are indeed delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from their bondage and captivity.</p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:43501:51"/>
               <p>2. Another Link in this Chain of falſe hopes whereby Captives are bound is a <hi>ſtrong (though falſe) perſwaſion of ſalvation by the death of Chriſt the Redeemer.</hi> If you ask many carnal, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and ungodly perſons, why they perſwade themſelves that they ſhall be ſaved, they will tell you, becauſe <hi>Chriſt died for ſinners, and I am a ſinner</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>God help me, as all men are, yea I am the chief of ſinners, and therefore I hope it ſhall go well with me;</hi> and ſo will a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſay, and a third, and <hi>multitudes</hi> will give no better account, without care or knowledg of applying the death of Chriſt unto them and the virtue and power of it, for the killing of their ſins; and thus the <hi>very means</hi> for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming of captives is abuſed to make their bonds the ſtronger, and keep them faſter bound in their Captivity.</p>
               <p>By way of Conceſſion it is granted, (1) that <hi>the death of Christ, and the ſatisfaction made to the justice of God thereby is the only meritorious cauſe of mans Redemption from his bondage and of Salvation,</hi> and whoſoever is ſaved, is ſaved by Chriſts death, for there is no other Saviour nor Redeemer beſides him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 12. and if Chriſt had not died, we had certainly been for ever captives without redemption. (2) It is true that <hi>this Redeemer is offred unto all where the Goſpel is preached,</hi> none are excluded from the offers of grace and pardon, and benefits of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and his death ſhall be ſufficient and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:43501:52"/> effectual for deliverance from bondage, and making of them free that do obey his call, and accept of him for <hi>Lord Redeemer,</hi> as offered in the Goſpel, <hi>Act. 10. 43. Joh.</hi> 3. 16. But yet that you might not through your own miſtake be the more enthralled by the means of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and be the faſter bound by the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding of the way of Salvation by the death of Chriſt. Conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If this were enough to prove your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and Salvation, becauſe Chriſt died for Sinners, and you acknowledg your ſelves to be ſuch, <hi>then the damned ſouls in Hell might have hope of being delivered and ſaved;</hi> for they know that Chriſt died for Sinners, and they are <hi>now ſenſible</hi> that they are Sinners and miſerable; the <hi>pains</hi> they feel do convince them that they are ſinners I know (as I have already ſaid) that there is a difference betwixt the ſtate of Devils and damned Souls, and of ſinners upon earth, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is preached to the one, and not to the other, <hi>freedom</hi> from bondage is <hi>poſſible</hi> to one but not to the other, <hi>mercy</hi> doth entreat, and the <hi>Spirit</hi> doth ſtrive, and <hi>patience</hi> doth wait upon the one, but not upon the other; <hi>mercy and patience hath done with them for ever;</hi> no more asking them, what? will you have Chriſt now? and will you be pardoned now? which yet through mercy is not your conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but yet as to the ground of your plea for Redemption and Salvation by Chriſt, (before
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:43501:52"/> alledged) [Chriſt died for ſinners and you are ſinners] what is the difference? all men upon earth, and the damned in hell, that ever heard of Chriſt might ſay as much; and is it not matter of great aſtoniſhment to ſober ſerious men, to ſee poor ſinners bound ſo faſt in a captive-ſtate with this vain confidence of being ſet free by Chriſt, and yet can ſay no more than damned Souls might ſay, [That they are ſinners, and Chriſt died for ſinners.]</p>

Lord Jeſus open unto us! Lord Jeſus now glorifie us with thy ſelf, ſave us, Oh ſave us now from yonder place of torment, from yonder flaming fire, from yonder Lake of burning brimſtone I Oh ſend us not down to yonder dreadful place, for we truſted in thy merits, and hoped to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved becauſe thou hadſt died!

Had you any warrant from me in my word ſo to do? or did my Miniſters whom I did ſend
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:43501:55"/> unto you tell you from me, that you may be ſaved by my death, though you did not repent, believe, nor were converted? did they? which is he? what is his name? Lo, here they ſtand, point <hi>him</hi> unto me, that did preach ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to you. My Miniſters come forth, what do you ſay againſt the <hi>priſoners</hi> at the bar? Lord we told them in thy name that there was a ranſome paid for captives by thy bleſſed ſelf, and that thou waſt willing they ſhould have the everlaſting benefit thereof; and we did ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for them, pray for them, and preach unto them thy ſufferings and thy death for ſinners, and did beg and intreat them to come unto thee; and when we did not prevail one day, we did prepare and preach the next, and ſo we did continue to do, as long as they lived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and till thou didſt call us from that work by death. <hi>But did you ever tell them that they ſhould be ſaved by my death, though they continued in their ſins; though they had no faith in me, though they were not ſanctified, nor converted.</hi> Oh no, our bleſſed Lord, we never did, we never did, <hi>there</hi> they ſtand before thee, they cannot ſay we ever did preach ſuch Doctrine to them; but on the contrary we told them from thy word which we made the <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>matter</hi> of our Sermons, and turned them to the places, where thou haſt ſaid, <hi>without holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> they ſhould not ſee thy face with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14.

               <p>
                  <hi>Beloved hearers,</hi> if this ſhall be the doleful end of vain and groundleſs hopes of unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable and unſcriptural confidence in the death of Chriſt, without faith and ſanctifying grace, be no longer kept as captives bound by this chain of falſe hopes of Heaven.</p>
               <p>3. Another Link in this Chain of falſe hopes wherewith theſe captives are bound, is, <hi>that they have oftentimes great trouble of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and inward terrours of mind after they
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43501:57"/> have committed ſin.</hi> I have ſaith one, been trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for my Oaths, and cried <hi>God forgive me,</hi> and if I have been drunk ſaith another, I have been troubled for it, ſometimes it breaks my ſleep, and ſometimes I cannot eat in peace, nor think of my ſin but my heart is filled with horror at the remembrance of it; and therefore I hope that I am redeemed by Chriſt, and got looſe from my bondage ſtate, and that God will have mercy on me, and will ſave my Soul. I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Falſe repentance is a ſtrengthning of falſe hopes, and many times the more the ſinner is troubled for his ſin, the faſter he is bound in his ſinful captive ſtate;</hi> the more tears do fall from thine eyes, the faſter are thy fetters lockt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy Soul, becauſe as true repentance maketh way for a well-grounded peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and for ſolid comfort, ſo a falſe and counterfeit repentance afterwards makes the ſinner more ſecure, and doth ſtrengthen his miſtake concerning his ſpiritual condition, he hath <hi>ſinned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and he hath <hi>ſorrowed,</hi> and now he thinketh <hi>all is well;</hi> and the Devil hath him faſter in his hold than he had before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Terrours of Conſcience for ſin, though great and grievous,</hi> in ſo much that thou art reſtleſs and weary of thy life, are <hi>no argument that of a captive thou art made free.</hi> Haſt thou ever been ſo much troubled as was <hi>Cain?</hi> or haſt thou ever been ſo filled with amazing horrors
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:43501:57"/> as was <hi>Judas?</hi> and yet theſe were captives to the Devil ſtill, and are bound in chains of ſin, and guilt, and puniſhment, to <hi>this day,</hi> and ſo ſhall be for ever; and who have greater terrors, reprovings and reproaches from their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, than the damned in Hell? and theſe terrors in thy ſoul and conſcience, might be the fore-runners and beginning of thoſe helliſh hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors thou ſhalt be filled with in another world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But <hi>what are thy terrors and thy tears, the agonies and anguiſh of thy heart, without an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward change?</hi> What are all theſe legal fits of ſorrow, while thou art the ſame man in ſinning ſtill, and thy love the ſame unto thy ſin; and when the temptation comes, thy courſe and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice is the ſame? If thou ſhouldſt <hi>wear</hi> the skin from off thy knees by going often to confeſs thy ſin, and <hi>weep</hi> thy ſelf blind, and <hi>pine</hi> away with ſorrow; yet if thy heart do ſecretly like thy ſin, and thou ſtill art not inwardly renewed, nor accepteſt of, nor cloſeſt with Chriſt by faith; whatever thy apprehenſions are of thy good condition, thou art ſtill a captive to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, eſpecially when one while thou ſeemeſt <hi>with ſorrow to lament thy ſin,</hi> and another while doſt with <hi>pleaſure and delight commit</hi> the ſin lamented; doſt commit the ſin, and then confeſs it; confeſs it, and go on again to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; and ſo like a ſlave indeed, runneſt round in the Devils Mill betwixt confeſſion and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:43501:58"/> of thy ſins, whereas in a true penitent there is the renovation of the heart, and the reformation of the life; a <hi>loathing</hi> and a <hi>leaving</hi> of the ſin lamented, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 31. &amp; 18. 30, 31. <hi>Iſa. 57. 7. Joel</hi> 2. 12, 13.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another Link in this Chain of falſe hopes, wherewith theſe Captives are bound, is, in <hi>that they have good meanings, and good wiſhes and deſires; and though they cannot diſcourſe as others can, nor have thoſe gifts that others have; yet they thank God their hearts are good, and ever were even from their childhood, and though they cannot utter themſelves, yet they have it in their hearts.</hi> Thus the Devil keepeth ſome in this fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and this bond; but towards the breaking of it conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Many have gone to hell with ſuch good meanings in their hearts, and with ſuch good wiſhes in their mouths;</hi> as <hi>Balaam</hi> for one, <hi>Numb. 23. 10, Let me dye the death of the righteous, and let my laſt end be like his.</hi> Who would not wiſh to be for ever happy? and who would not wiſh to be freed from eternal miſery, pain, and torment? But theſe things are not got with ſuch lazy wiſhes; neither do you approve of them in your idle ſervants, that ſit ſtill and wiſh their work were done.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>But can your meanings be good, in many of your wicked acts, and in your ſinful neglects?</hi> What good meaning is it in thee, to keep Chriſt
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:43501:58"/> out of thy heart? to prophane Gods Sabbaths? What good meaning haſt thou, in neglecting to make thy peace with God? in not ſeeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grace and fitneſs for Heaven?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>If thy meanings were good, this doth not make thy action good,</hi> nor thy life good; and can it then prove thy condition to be good?</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>If thy heart were good, thy life would be ſo too.</hi> The life indeed might be good before men, where the heart is bad before God; but if the heart be good before God, the life will be good before men; for <hi>a good tree bringeth forth good fruit,</hi> Mat. 7. 17, 18. and your not-ſeeing the badneſs of your hearts, is an evidence that yet they are not good; and the more you juſtifie the goodneſs of your hearts, in the neglect of your duty, it is the clearer demonſtration that yet they are not good; and that thy heart, which thou vainly thinkeſt is the beſt part in thee, is indeed the worſt of all, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 9, 10. Thou a good heart ever ſince thou waſt born! then there hath been a good Devil ever ſince he ſinned, and when he ceaſed to be good.</p>

Whereas thou ſayeſt, <hi>Thou haſt good things in thy heart, though thou canſt not expreſs them with thy tongue.</hi> What is thy heart ſo full of good? and is it ſo locked up there, that there is no vent for it?

What! nothing of this good boaſted of? no, not in broken language? But if we follow you to your ſhops, there you want no words, there your tongues go glib; Who have words at command more than you? You can talk roundly of the World, of your Goods, and your Eſtates, of your Furniture and Apparel; but in the things of God you are mute. This is plain, it is not for want of words in theſe, but for want of a work of God upon their hearts. Therefore let not the Devil keep thee any longer bound with this chain, a vain conceit of the goodneſs of thy heart, thy wiſhings, and thy meanings.</p>
               <p>5. Another Link in this Chain of falſe hopes wherewith theſe Captives are bound, is on the contrary, in <hi>that they have ſtrong parts, great knowledg in the things of God, are very full of good diſcourſe;</hi> for the Devil hath ſeveral Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for his ſeveral Priſoners; and ſeveral Chains

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore becauſe this Fetter is ſo ſtrong, if poſſible to knock it off from theſe captive ſinners, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer me to theſe few following queſtions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>What if Christ himſelf in perſon were now amongſt you, and preaching to you, and telling you with his own mouth, That theſe alledged grounds of thy hopes of heaven, and redemption by his blood, were not ſound nor warrantable, wouldſt thou after this hope thou art redeemed, and ſhalt be ſaved?</hi> If Chriſt were viſibly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and you ſhould hear him with your own ears telling you, That the Drunkard is a captive to the Devil, and ſhall not be ſaved; would you ſay, No, we are not in bondage to the Devil, or our ſins, and therefore <hi>will</hi> hope we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed and ſhall be ſaved? Wouldſt thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Chriſt himſelf? or wouldſt thou not? If thou wouldſt not, how ſhall I hope thou wilt hearken to my words? If thou ſayeſt thou wouldſt believe him, why then wilt thou not believe what Chriſt hath indeed <hi>already</hi> ſpoken, and left recorded in his Word? The ſame Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that Chriſt preached in perſon in the world, is faithfully recorded in the Goſpel. In his Sermon that he preached on the Mount, he tells you, that <hi>Except your righteouſneſs exceed
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43501:60"/> the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, you ſhall in no wiſe enter into the kingdom of heaven, Mat.</hi> 5. 20. And doth the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of <hi>groſs</hi> ſinners, yea or cloſe hypocrites, either exceed the righteouſneſs of the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees</hi> and the <hi>Scribes,</hi> who walked ſo ſtrictly, that many would have judged, if but <hi>two</hi> men ſhould be ſaved, the <hi>Scribe</hi> ſhould be one, and the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee</hi> another? What Chriſts Doctrine was, ſee again, <hi>Luk. 13. 3. 5. Mar. 16. 16. Mat.</hi> 18. 3. And yet when Chriſt tells you, <hi>Except ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, ye ſhall periſh;</hi> and <hi>except ye believe, ye ſhall be damned;</hi> and <hi>except ye be converted, ye ſhall not enter into the kingdom of God;</hi> you do remain captives ſtill; and do you not repent, nor believe, nor are converted, and yet will you hope you are freemen, and ſhall be ſaved? The truth is, if you do not believe Chriſts mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters preaching Chriſts own words, neither would you believe Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Luk. 10. 16, He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me; and he that deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me;</hi> not to hear is to deſpiſe, and whom do you deſpiſe when you do not hear and obey the doctrine preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the Scripture? is it <hi>poor mortal</hi> men? No, but you deſpiſe Chriſt, and God himſelf. Believe me then, or believe rather Chriſt himſelf, that tells thee, without convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-grace thou ſhalt be damned, and except thou art converted do not hope thou art deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:43501:61"/> out of thy Captivity, or that thou ſhalt be ſaved, and ſo be befooled by the Devil, and thereby be kept ſtill in bondage by him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What if God ſhould ſend an Angel from heaven to thee, and tell thee while thou art a drunkard ſwearer, profane, a lyar, an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, a worldling, art unſanctified, Thou art a captive to the Devil, and abiding ſo, ſhalt not be ſaved?</hi> Wouldſt thou after ſuch a meſſage from God by a glorious Angel, ſtill hope thou art made free, and ſhalt be ſaved? Or would you <hi>then</hi> leave your ſins, and look after Grace, and make it your buſineſs to get out of bondage? Why, if an Angel ſhould come from Heaven, he would preach <hi>this</hi> Doctrine to you, the <hi>very ſame</hi> that is contained in the Word of God, or elſe a bleſſed Angel would be a curſed Creature, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8. But behold, you have a ſurer and more certain way of knowing the mind of God, and that is the Scripture, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17, 18, 19.

               </argument>
               <p>5. ANother Chain whereby ſome Captives are faſt bound is contrary to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, a <hi>deſpairing of mercy;</hi> not only a deſpai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in a mans ſelf, ſeeing an utter inability to help himſelf, <hi>this is neceſſary,</hi> but a deſpairing of pardon and ſalvation notwithſtanding the <hi>mercy of God,</hi> and the <hi>merit of Chriſt;</hi> through which pardon and ſalvation is tendered unto them. The Devil uſeth <hi>various,</hi> yea <hi>contrary</hi> means and methods to hold faſt ſinners in their bonds; if he can, he will keep them from a ſight and ſenſe of ſin and miſery thereby: If he cannot, but God openeth a ſinners eyes and awakeneth his conſcience, the Devil will ſet out his ſins with all the <hi>aggravations</hi> of them, but indeavours to keep from the <hi>ſight of Chriſt; ſometimes</hi> perſwading ſinners that their ſins are <hi>not ſo great,</hi> but they may do well enough, <hi>ſometimes</hi> that they are <hi>ſo hainous,</hi> that there is <hi>no hope,</hi> nor <hi>help</hi> for them: <hi>ſometimes</hi> he blinds their eyes that they ſee no need of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; <hi>ſometimes</hi> he ſhews them their ſin in a <hi>multiplying</hi> or <hi>magnifying glaſs,</hi> that a Saviour can do them no good; and the poor captive is
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:43501:67"/> held and kept from Chriſt the Redeemer either way, thought it is more rare, that ſinners do <hi>deſpair,</hi> but it is more frequent and more ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary for them to <hi>preſume;</hi> as it was ſaid of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David; Saul</hi> ſlew his thouſands, but <hi>David</hi> his ten thouſands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 7. ſo we might ſay, if <hi>thouſands</hi> periſh in their captivity by <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,</hi> there are <hi>ten thouſands</hi> many times told, that periſh by <hi>preſumption</hi> and falſe hopes of Heaven. Sometimes the ſinner cries out with <hi>Cain,</hi> Gen. 4. 13. <hi>My ſin is greater than can be forgiven;</hi> and with <hi>Judas</hi> is tempted to deſpair, and to deſtroy himſelf.</p>
               <p>But that the poor Captive that is convinced of his ſins, might not be kept from Chriſt the Redeemer by this bond, I ſhall ſpeak three things towards the breaking of it. Doſt thou then cry out in the anguiſh of thy ſoul, <hi>Oh the greatneſs of my ſins, they are ſcarlet, crimſon ſins! oh the Number of my ſins, they cannot be reckoned up! there is not a viler wretch upon Gods earth, not a man that hath a worſer heart, that breaths in Gods air; did you know me, and the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I am guilty of, and were privy to my ſecret ſins, you would think as well as I that there is no mercy for me; that there is no hope.</hi> Let ſuch a ſoul conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The mercies of God are more and greater than thy ſins,</hi> let them be never ſo great, never ſo many; thy wickedneſs doth not exceed Gods Goodneſs; his goodneſs is the goodneſs of a
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:43501:67"/> God, and his mercy the mercy of a God, and therefore Infinite, without <hi>bounds, limits,</hi> or <hi>meaſure.</hi> It is as eaſie for Infinite mercy to forgive many ſins as few, and great as ſmall; the Sea covereth great rocks as well as the ſmalleſt ſands. If thou haſt a <hi>multitude of ſins,</hi> God hath a <hi>multitude of mercies,</hi> Pſal. 51. 1. if thou haſt <hi>manifold ſins,</hi> God hath <hi>manifold mercies,</hi> Nehem. 9. 19. if thou haſt <hi>abundantly ſinned,</hi> God can and will <hi>abundantly pardon,</hi> Iſa. 55. 7, 8 if thy ſins be ſins of <hi>all ſorts,</hi> of <hi>all ſizes,</hi> God can and will <hi>forgive iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin,</hi> Exod. 34. 6, 7. <hi>only</hi> be thou <hi>willing, heartily willing</hi> to leave thy ſins, <hi>only</hi> be thou <hi>willing, ſoundly willing, unfeignedly willing</hi> to accept of mercy as it is tendered to thee, and of Chriſt the Redeemer as he is offered to thee, and the number, the greatneſs of thy ſin ſhall not hinder thee from pardon and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The merits of Chriſt the Redeemer are fully ſufficient to purchaſe pardon for thy ſins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were they more and greater than they be.</hi> Dareſt thou ſay thy ſinnings are more than Chriſts ſufferings; or that thy debts for which thou art in bonds are more than Chriſt the Surety for poor captives is able to ſatisfie and pay? <hi>Chriſt hath more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, than thou haſt ſins; more healings than thou haſt wounds;</hi> there is more in Chriſt to ſave thee, than in thy ſins to condemn thee: thy ſins are but <hi>pennies</hi> in compariſon of the

               <p>6. ANother Chain wherewith many of theſe Captives are bound is <hi>their ſatisfying themſelves with a moral blameleſs life;</hi> ſaith one, I live peaceably among my neighbours; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud no man, I am juſt in all my dealings, I give to every one their due; ſaith another, I am no drunkard, no ſwearer, no open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faner of Sabbaths, no man can lay any thing to my charge, nor ſay black is my eye. Many ſinners reſt here, and do perſwade themſelves their condition is good, and do not think that they are in bondage to the Devil, and ſo do not look out after Redemption by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:43501:71"/>
               <p>Though all this be good in it ſelf, yet it doth not argue that thy condition is good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not ſufficient to ſalvation, foraſmuch as God requireth this and ſomething more; nay, much more than this that thou mayſt be meet for Heaven: towards the breaking of this bond, Conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Negative holineſs is not a ground of hope for future glory, nor a proof of a preſent good condition.</hi> Negatives in reference to affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Precepts will damn, but negatives in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to forbidding Precepts will not ſave. There are commands of God enjoyning you to repent, and believe, to pray and to forſake ſin; your <hi>not repenting, not believing,</hi> will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do your ſouls; and there are commands en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning you to be no drunkards, to be no ſwearers, not to defraud, nor over reach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in your dealings; now if you be no <hi>drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards,</hi> yet if you are not <hi>believers</hi> you are ſtill in Satans bonds: you muſt not only not do evil, but you muſt alſo do that which is good. <hi>Iſa. 1. 16, 17. Mat.</hi> 25. 42.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If thou art of an unblameable life, yet thou haſt a corrupt and ſinful heart;</hi> if thou hadſt been free all thy life-long from every actual ſin, (as thou art not) yet there is ſin enough in thy heart to ſink thee to the loweſt hell. There is heart-adultery, and heart-murder, pride of heart, and unbelief in thy heart; ſo that though thou ſayſt, <hi>fair is thy life,</hi> yet God
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:43501:71"/> doth ſee, that <hi>foul and filthy is thy heart;</hi> and it is not unblameableneſs of life only, but pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of heart too, that muſt qualifie you for the enjoyment of God, <hi>Mat. 5. 8. Heb.</hi> 12. 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Haſt thou wronged no man? what! nor God neither?</hi> doſt thou give to every man his due? what! and to God too? thy heart is Gods due, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 26. doſt thou give to God thy heart, which is his due? thy love, and obedience is Gods due, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 37. doſt thou indeed give theſe to God? thy time, and ſervice, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worſhip is Gods due, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 10. doſt thou deny theſe unto God, and yet boaſt thou giveſt to every one their due? or doſt thou look upon it as an evil, to withhold from man, that which doth belong to him, and is it not a greater evil to withhold from God, that which doth belong to him? wilt thou <hi>pay to men, and rob God,</hi> and yet hold thy ſelf guiltleſs? wilt thou be righteous towards men, and unholy towards God, and yet hold thy ſelf innocent? whereas the ſame God that doth command thee to live <hi>ſoberly</hi> towards thy ſelf, and <hi>righteouſly</hi> towards men, doth alſo charge thee to be <hi>holy</hi> towards him, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 12. What if thou art at peace with all men, if thou art not at peace with God? art thou not a captive ſtill? what, if thou art in charity with all the world (as thou makeſt thy boaſt) if thou haſt no love to God? art thou not in fetters ſtill? what if thou beareſt no malice in thy heart to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:43501:72"/> any man, yet if thy heart be full of hatred and enmity to God, hath not the Devil yet faſt hold on thee? Didſt thou never read <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 18, 19, 20. that that Moraliſt ſaid as much as thou doſt ſay, and yet he remained ſtill in the bonds of his Iniquity? Didſt thou never read <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 11. where the Phariſee boaſted unto God himſelf, that he <hi>was not as other men are, that he was no Extortioner, no Adulterer, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, and yet being not justified was faſt bound in the guilt of ſin?</hi> A moral man without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting, ſanctifying grace, is like a <hi>Swine</hi> in a fair Meadow; that though it be not there wallowing in the mire, yet it is a ſwine ſtill. Oh then ſtay not here; ſince there are many now in hell that were not common drunkards, ſwearers, nor profane debauched perſons, let not Satan keep thee any longer bound in thy captive ſtate with this bond of thy applauded moral converſation.</p>
               <p>7. Another Chain with which ſome Captives are bound, is their <hi>reſting in religious and holy duties;</hi> theſe go a ſtep higher than the former, and yet are as faſt bound as others be, and faſter too; for when many groſs ſinners are delivered from captivity, and their bonds are broke, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites are faſt entangled with chains of their own making. Publicans and Harlots enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of God, when Hypocrites are ſhut out, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21 31. as <hi>Paul</hi> compared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:43501:72"/> with others, 2 <hi>Cor. 11. 22. Are they He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews? ſo am I. Are they Iſraelites? ſo am I. Are they the ſeed of</hi> Abraham? <hi>ſo am I. 23. Are they Miniſters of Christ?—I am more, in Labours more abundant, in ſtripes above meaſure, in priſons more frequent, in deaths oft.</hi> So hypocrites comparing themſelves with thoſe that are ſet at liberty by Chriſt in reſpect of <hi>all external duties,</hi> and <hi>common gifts,</hi> conceiting that therefore they are free too, are the faſter bound. Are Gods free-men much in prayer? ſo am I, ſaith the Hypocrite. Are they frequent in hearing? ſo am I. Are they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to all Ordinances, and received into Church-fellowſhip by the godly, ſtrict, and careful Miniſters of Chriſt? ſo am I. Do they talk and diſcourſe of God, and Chriſt, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? ſo do I, and more than many of them do. Do they ſuffer for Religion, and have been in bonds and priſons for Religious worſhipping of God? So have I.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſtrong bonds, and the more they pray and hear, the ſtronger are their bonds, while they are praying and hearing, the Devil is <hi>binding</hi> theſe captive-hypocrites ſo much the faſter, and this is their miſery more eſpecially, that theſe <hi>Chains</hi> which are made for their <hi>cloſe impriſonment,</hi> they do look upon as <hi>chains of ornament,</hi> and do glory in them. For the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Bond, Conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The external performance of Religious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:43501:73"/> hath been done by many now in Hell,</hi> ſome of the <hi>now</hi> damned ſouls when in their bodies, were often preſent at Sermons as well as you, and often on their knees as well as you; and yet were then in the bonds of ſin, and you alſo yet may be, and are now in chains in utter darkneſs, which God in mercy grant you may never be. <hi>Outward duties</hi> may be done to God, when there is <hi>Inward prevailing love</hi> to ſelf, to ſin, and to the world; it is not ſo much the <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> as the <hi>manner</hi> of your duties, that argues your freedom from captivity, not <hi>what</hi> you do, as <hi>from what principle,</hi> and <hi>for what end</hi> you do them that doth diſtinguiſh the Devils cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives from the Lords free-men. Chriſt plainly tells you, that not every one that makes a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Religion ſhall be delivered from the priſon of Hell, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 21, 22, 23. and that the children of the Kingdom ſhall be caſt into outer darkneſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 12. Know therefore though you ſhould hear ten thouſand Sermons, and make as many prayers, yet <hi>without an inward real change</hi> by converting grace upon your hearts, except you love God above all, and chuſe and prize Chriſt before all, that you may not be releaſed from captivity for the preſent, nor ſaved hereafter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There is no certain judgment can be made of your ſpiritual ſlavery or freedom by the thoughts that others have of you</hi> Men judg <hi>charitably,</hi> but God judgeth <hi>certainly.</hi> Men judg of your
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:43501:73"/> 
                  <hi>hearts</hi> by your <hi>actions,</hi> but God judgeth of your <hi>actions by your hearts;</hi> you might be admitted among the pureſt Congregation, and yet not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into Heaven. If Chriſt himſelf were upon the earth thou mighteſt be an hearer of Chriſt, and yet a captive to the Devil. Chriſt tells you as much, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 26, 27, 28. And I pray you, what is it to be applauded or appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by men, and to be condemned by God? You are not to ſtand or fall, to be damned or ſaved by what men think of you, but by what God knows of you. Remember <hi>Judas,</hi> that carried himſelf ſo amongſt others, that the reſt of the Diſciples did rather ſuſpect themſelves than him, ſaying, <hi>Lord is it I?</hi> and another, <hi>is it I,</hi> when Chriſt told them, one of them ſhould betray him. Remember him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, that as others are bound captives with the bonds of open and <hi>viſible iniquity,</hi> that you remain not bound with the bonds of hidden and ſecret Hypocriſie.</p>

ANother Chain by which ſome are held captive is <hi>the Examples of others.</hi> And theſe are either the examples 1. of thoſe that <hi>lived formerly,</hi> or 2. thoſe that are <hi>now alive.</hi> And ſaith one, <hi>I am of the ſame Religion as my fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers were; my Father, and my Fathers Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were of this way; and who will ſay our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers were not Redeemed, nor are ſaved? who will ſay that our fore-fathers died captives and are gone down to hell? will any zealous Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of them all condemn our Fore-fathers?

               <p n="1">1. <hi>We have nothing to do to paſs any ſentence upon your Fore-fathers,</hi> they are out of the reach
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:43501:74"/> of our preaching and exhortations: them we leave to the righteous judgment of God, who hath diſpoſed of them <hi>before this day</hi> to the places where they muſt for ever be; and God doth not ſend us to tell you, whither your Fore-fathers ſouls are gone; our Meſſage is to you that are yet alive, and our buſineſs and imployment is to tell you of your ſin and miſery, and to call you unto repentance, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with the conditions of peace to be made betwixt God and you: to tell you, what <hi>you</hi> muſt be, and what <hi>you</hi> muſt do to eſcape the Damnation of Hell, and to be partakers of the Redemption which Chriſt hath purchaſed for poor captive ſinners.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>You might be of the ſame profeſſion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as your Fore-fathers were, and they might be ſaved, and yet you might be damned;</hi> they might be redeemed and delivered, and yet you remain captives ſtill. Your Fore-fathers profeſſed faith in Chriſt, did pray to God, and performed religious duties unto God, as you profeſs to do; and yet if they did theſe things ſincerely, and you hypocritically, they in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and you in ſhew, their ſouls are now in glory and at reſt, where your ſouls notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding may never be. Many of the ſame age make the ſame profeſſion, and yet ſome are good, and ſome are bad; ſome are made free, and ſome continue captives: as the five fooliſh Virgins made the ſame profeſſion as the wiſe,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:43501:75"/> 
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 1. to 13. and <hi>Judas,</hi> as the reſt of the Diſciples; and yet the one was captivated, while the others were Redeemed; and ſo it may be with perſons that live and profeſs in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ages.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But <hi>why ſhould you content your ſelves in being ſuch as your Fore-fathers were?</hi> though I do not, dare not, will not ſay that they are damned; yet are you <hi>ſo ſure</hi> that they are ſaved? are you all ſure, that all your Fore-fathers did believe, and did repent; that they were all ſanctified and ſaved? <hi>if ſo,</hi> ſurely <hi>that age was better than this,</hi> and better it would have been to have lived then, than Now. But if they did not believe, did not repent, would you then go to the place where now they are? or would it be any eaſe to your pain, to meet any of your Fore-fathers there? your wiſeſt, ſafeſt courſe, is not to ſay, we will live as our Fore-fathers did, but as God in his Word doth command and direct you to do.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But <hi>why might you not be wiſer and better than your Fore-fathers were?</hi> Were they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in wiſdom and goodneſs? If they were not wiſe indeed for heaven and their ſouls, and if they were not good indeed, you muſt be wiſer and better than they were, or you ſhall not be ſaved. If they were truly wiſe and good, it was their burden and their grief that they were no wiſer, and no better, and why ſhould that be a fault in you to be wiſer than they
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:43501:75"/> were, which they complained of as a fault in themſelves that they were no wiſer, and no better than they were?</p>
               <p>Beſides, would you not be <hi>richer</hi> than your Fore-fathers were? and <hi>greater</hi> and more <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable</hi> in the World if poſſibly you can? Do not you labour for greater Eſtates than they had, had they much or had they little? had they little, would not you have much? had they much, would not you have more? If you would be richer and greater, why may you not endeavour to be wiſer, and to be better than they were?</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>What if ſome of your Fore-fathers ſhould come from the dead, and tell you they were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, and deceived, and are damned, and have been in hell ever ſince they died,</hi> would you think your ſelves concern'd then to be wiſer and to be better than they were? if your <hi>Father</hi> or your <hi>Fathers Father</hi> ſhould come to any of you, and ſay, Oh! do not ſleight Chriſt as we did, do not you, our poor poſterity, remain in a natural ſtate as we did, and are now ſuffering the wrath of God, and the vengeance of eternal flames; Oh! do not follow <hi>our example,</hi> nor lead your lives <hi>as we did,</hi> and neglect to worſhip God in your families, or do it by the halfs, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly and negligently <hi>as we did,</hi> leſt you come to the ſame place of torment, as we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned into, and muſt be in for ever: take the <hi>Scripture for your rule, and not our

If you content your ſelves to live and die as we did, captives to the Devil; and your children after you, content themſelves to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and to imitate you, as you do to imitate and to follow us, the race that did deſcend from us will be damned from one generation to another. Would you after ſuch warning as this, plead your Fore-fathers examples no more? let not then the Devil lead you any longer captives by this bond of their example, as if this were more binding than the commands of God.</p>
               <p>For the breaking of the other piece of this Cord wherewith the Devil binds his Captives; the examples of thoſe that live in the ſame age, the moſt live as I do; will God damn ſuch mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes? if it go ill with me, God help many others. Conſider,</p>

               </argument>
               <p>HAving ſet before you the reſemblance of Sinners to Captives, and ſeveral of the chains by which they are bound in this captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; I ſhall next proceed to ſhew you wherein the condition of theſe Captives is far worſe than any Captives under the Sun beſides; and I beſeech you in <hi>the fear of God,</hi> ſeriouſly weigh your danger, and in good ſadneſs conſider your miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry before you are paſt remedy recovery, and redemption. If all I have already ſaid be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and hath been ſlighted by you; yet do not ſtop your ears, ſtiffen your necks, and harden your hearts againſt what ſhall further be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to you to awaken your Conſciences. In reſpect of <hi>civil Liberty</hi> you are all free-born, and many of you are <hi>free Citizens;</hi> but yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Satans Captives, and Sins Bond-men, your caſe is <hi>deplorable;</hi> though yet through Mercy tendered to you, and waiting to this day upon you, it is not <hi>deſperate.</hi> If it ſhould move com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion in us to hear of any carried captive by a cruel Enemy, as <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s eyes were filled with tears, and his heart with ſorrow, when he did
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:43501:79"/> conſider of the captive-ſtate of Gods people, Jer. 13. 17, <hi>But if ye will not hear it, my ſoul ſhall weep in ſecret places for your pride, and mine eye ſhall weep ſore, and run down with tears, becauſe the Lords flock is carried away captive.</hi> Lam. 1. 18,—<hi>hear, I pray you, all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and behold my ſorrow; my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.</hi> Much more ſhould it be lamented with abundant tears and ſorrow of heart, that ſinners are captivated by the Devil, by how much this captivity is ſorer than any other; as appeareth by theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is ſpiritual bondage, and the captivity of the ſoul:</hi> If a man be a ſlave to men, they have power only over his body and outward man, his ſoul may be free: the more noble the ſubject is, the more grievous is the bondage. Things that concern the ſoul, if <hi>good,</hi> they be the <hi>beſt,</hi> as <hi>promiſes</hi> of bleſſings to the ſoul are the beſt promiſes, and <hi>mercies</hi> for the ſoul are the beſt mercies; ſo if things that concern the ſoul be <hi>bad,</hi> they are the <hi>worſt: threatnings</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſoul are the ſoreſt threatnings, and puniſhments upon the ſoul are the ſoreſt and the heavieſt puniſhments; and the <hi>loſs</hi> of the ſoul is the greateſt loſs, <hi>Mat. 16. 26; What is a man profited if he gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul? or what ſhall a man give in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for his ſoul?</hi> It were better to have the body fettered with as many chains as it could
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:43501:80"/> carry, if the ſoul be free, than to have the body be at liberty to go up and down where you will, if the body be in bondage to Satan and to Sin: <hi>Sinner,</hi> it is thy <hi>ſoul,</hi> thy <hi>only, precious,</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſoul</hi> that is in chains; and canſt thou be at reſt, eat, drink, and ſleep, with ſo much peace, while thy ſoul is carried captive? <hi>Canſt</hi> thou be ſo merry and ſo jovial with fetters on thy ſoul? <hi>Canst</hi> thou buy, and ſell, and trade with ſo much earneſtneſs after worldly gain, while Satan hath poſſeſſion of thy ſoul? If thy Lands were mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, wouldſt thou not be careful to redeem them? If thy Jewels were in pawn, wouldſt thou not be mindful to have them to be reſtored to thee? What! doſt thou prize and value a few acres of Land, the very Earth thou tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt upon, above thy ſoul? Are a thouſand Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els better than this one only Jewel of thy Soul? Wouldſt thou not be moved with pity to ſee Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors (whoſe time of execution is approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) card and dice, carowſe and drink, and ſing with chains ratling at their heels? And haſt thou no pity for thy ſelf, and no compaſſion for thy ſelf, whoſe time of death and execution draweth nigh, and will quickly come, and yet canſt be ſo light-hearted, when the Devil hath thy ſoul in worſe than Iron-fetters? <hi>Doth not this lightneſs of thy heart plainly prove the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy heart?</hi> Remember, thou hadſt better have thy body poſſeſſed by a thouſand Devils, or torn by a thouſand Devils into a thouſand
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:43501:80"/> pieces, than to have thy precious ſoul led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by the Devil, and held his Priſoner by the reigning-power of any one luſt whatſoever. Wilt thou think of this, It is thy ſoul that is a Captive, and in bonds?</p>
               <p n="2">2. This captivity and bondage to Satan and to Sin, is worſe than any other, in that <hi>theſe Captives are not ſenſible of their thraldom;</hi> do not lament themſelves, nor bewail their own condition, though it be ſo bad, ſo very bad. The children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did groan and ſigh by reaſon of their bondage, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. 22. When <hi>Manaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeh</hi> was bound with fetters, and carried captive to <hi>Babylon,</hi> he was ſenſible of the fetters on his body, that had before no ſenſe of the bonds of ſin, with which he was held in bondage by the Devil. And how do poor Captives ſigh and groan under Turkiſh ſlavery, and bitterly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment becauſe of the hard uſage they are under? And how do many Priſoners grieve and take on that they ever did that fact for which they are in Irons? Do men need to ſpend many hours, and make many long Orations, to convince a Captive amongſt the <hi>Turks</hi> of the ſadneſs of his condition there? But how many hours muſt a Miniſter ſpend in ſtudying and in preaching, before theſe Captives can be brought to a ſenſe of their own woful and miſerable condition? Before he can convince that indeed they are in this captivity? It is indeed but here and there one amongſt a multitude that do ſee it, believe
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:43501:81"/> it, and bewail it. Who is witneſs of your groans, and of your tears? When did you complain to God or man of the fetters and the bonds of ſin that have been ſo long upon your ſouls? When didſt thou retire to thy Cloſet, and there lament thy woful caſe? Is not this a dreadful caſe to be near to Hell, and not to ſee it? to be near dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and not to fear it? to be led by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in the chains of ſin, to a place of torment, and to be not at all ſenſible whither you are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Shall nothing but the flames of Hell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince thee of thy bondage? Wilt thou not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Devil is leading thee to Hell, till thou ſeeſt, and findeſt, and feeleſt, that thou art there? Wilt thou not yield that thou art of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Satans Captives upon earth, till he brings thee to the Lake of burning Brimſtone, and look round about thee, and then to thy eternal ſorrow ſee, that thou art one of the number of the captivated ſouls in Hell? This makes thy captivity the ſorer, and thy bonds the ſtronger, that thou art not ſenſible of thy bondage.</p>
               <p n="3">3. So doth this too, that <hi>thou art a voluntary bond-ſlave to Satan and to Sin;</hi> thou art the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils ſervant, and art willing to be ſo; in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and art willing to remain therein; <hi>thou mighteſt have liberty, but thou wilt not.</hi> Thou art like the ſervant that plainly ſaid, I love my Maſter, I will not go out free; and would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have his ears bored through with an Awl, and ſerve him for ever, than be made free, <hi>Exod.</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:43501:81"/> 21. 5, 6. Slaves in <hi>Turkie</hi> are there againſt their wills, it is not matter of their choice; Captives they be, but they are not willing Captives; they do not love their fetters, nor their chains, nor the work and ſervice that they are there put unto: but thou art in Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity to Satan, and thou loveſt to have it ſo; thou drudgeſt in his ſervice, and doſt love to do it; but what wilt thou do in the end thereof? <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 31. Others are by power and force taken and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Captives, but thou doſt voluntarily yeild thy ſelf to be a ſlave; for Satan could not have taken men captive, nor hold them therein, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their own conſent. Like <hi>Ahab,</hi> thou doſt ſell thy ſelf for a ſlave, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. 20: and what doſt thou ſell thy ſelf, thy ſoul, a captive for? For a little profit, and for a little ſhort and momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary pleaſure? That thou mighteſt gratifie thy luſts for a while, and pleaſe thy palate and thy fleſh for a while, thou art contented to be a ſlave for ever. When a man is taken captive, <hi>yet his will is not taken;</hi> when his body is fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, yet his will is not overcome; he hath a will to reſiſt ſtill, if he had but power; he hath a will to have off his chains, though he cannot; and a will to eſcape, and be ſet at liberty, though there is none to lay down a ranſome for him: But the Devils Captives have no will to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or freed from their bondage, though there be a ranſome paid, and the benefit of it be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto them.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:43501:82"/>4. <hi>It is a plenary and full Captivity;</hi> all the Sinner is in bondage, not only the Will, but all the powers and affections of the ſoul; ſo that there is nothing in him free. If a man be in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to men, his thoughts might be free, and his affections might be free, free to love God, free to delight in God, free to deſire after God. But Satans Captives have no freedom to any thing that is ſpiritually good and pleaſing unto God; therefore this is a ſore bondage.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Theſe Captives are Children of the Wrath of God;</hi> whereas others that are Captives to men, might be Children of the Love of God; as they love and delight in God when they be in chains, ſo God may love and delight in them. If a mans outward condition be never ſo bad, yet he might comfort himſelf with the thoughts of Gods love to him; <hi>though I be in priſon, yet God loves me; and though I be in chains, yet God loves me:</hi> But the Devils Captives do not love God, nor are beloved by him. A love of <hi>good-will</hi> God hath had to many of theſe Captives, a love of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to do them good in delivering them from their bonds; but a love of <hi>complacency</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,</hi> ſo that God ſhould take pleaſure in you while you are voluntarily and totally the Devils Slaves and Servants, there is not in God towards you. O did you but know the Wrath of God, the Fury of the Lord, what it is, how great, how intolerable; Could you pleaſe your ſelves in that condition in which you are the objects
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:43501:82"/> of his Wrath? As there is no love like to the love of God; ſo there is no wrath like to the wrath of God; therefore that condition (be it what it will) is not ſo bad in which you may be the object of Gods love, as that condition is in which you are and <hi>muſt</hi> be the objects of his wrath.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Death doth not deliver Satans Captives from their thraldom and their bondage, but doth ſtraiten their bonds, and ſtrengthen their chains, and puts them into an impoſſibility of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ever.</hi> If a ſlave be no way deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed while he liveth, yet he is freed when he dyes; death will bring him a releaſe, and give him a diſcharge; Job 3. 17. <hi>There the wicked ceaſe from troubling; and there the weary be at reſt. 18. There the priſoners rest together, they hear not the voice of the oppreſſor. 19. The ſmall and great are there, and the ſervant is free from his maſter.</hi> When the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Zedekiah</hi> captive, and bound him in fetters, he put him in priſon till the day of his death, and then he was his priſoner no longer, <hi>Jer.</hi> 52. 12. But theſe are Captives <hi>till they dye,</hi> and which is worſe, are Captives <hi>after death.</hi> The others might ſay, and comfort themſelves therewith, <hi>Well, this is hard, but it is not laſting; this is bitter, but it will have an end;</hi> though it laſt as long as life ſhall laſt, yet death will come, and then we ſhall be releaſed; but theſe may ſay, <hi>It is bad while we live, and it will be worſe when we dye:</hi> if we
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:43501:83"/> are not delivered while we live, death will not, death cannot deliver us. Therefore this is worſe than any other bondage.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>A worſe and more dreadful Priſon is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Devils Captives, than any ſlaves in earth can be caſt into.</hi> Hell is the Priſon appointed and prepared for all Captives that are not made free by Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 19. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things make this Priſon worſe than any other.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Priſon prepared for theſe Captives is a <hi>cloſe Priſon.</hi> Now you are like to Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that ſometimes might walk abroad with their Keeper with them. Now thou art a <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner at large,</hi> that walkeſt up and down, though in thy Chains of ſin and guilt, and the Devil thy Keeper doth attend and watch thee whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever thou goeſt; if thou comeſt to a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, thy Keeper cometh with thee, to prevent thy breaking looſe, and when thou goeſt from the Sermon, to tempt thee to return to thy courſe of ſin again. But hereafter thou ſhalt be a <hi>cloſe Priſoner,</hi> not ſuffered to ſtep out for ever; and ſo cloſe ſhalt thou be kept, that none ſhall come at thee, to viſit or to comfort thee. It is an alleviation of a Priſoners grief, though he hath not liberty to go out and ſee his friends, yet his friends might come and ſee and viſit him; but neither ſhall be allowed unto you, when once you are cloſe priſoners in hell. Thy friends on earth will not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:43501:83"/> of thy company, or thy viſits after death, if thou hadſt the liberty to come forth; ſuch viſits of damned Souls would be a burden, and diſquietment, and a terror to the living; that would then rather wiſh that thou waſt confined to thy priſon, than to be permitted to come forth to diſturb them by thy viſits: Neither ſhall any be ſuffered to come and comfort thee, if they would; and indeed, none would be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, nor venture ſo far to come to hell to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thee, if they might. Though the rich man deſired that <hi>Lazarus</hi> might come and comfort him with one drop of water, it would not be granted to him, for he was a cloſe priſoner, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 24, 25. Beſides, there is a great gulf fixed between them and the Saints above, that there is no paſſing from the one place to the other, <hi>ver.</hi> 26.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It is a dark priſon,</hi> a very dungeon, a place of utter darkneſs, a place where there is thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and blackneſs of darkneſs for ever, <hi>Mat. 25. 30. Jude v.</hi> 13. Darkneſs addeth to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort of the condition they muſt be in, in that priſon for ever. It was an amazing Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> to be under <hi>thick dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> for three days, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10. 22, 23. What a dreadful dungeon would this world be, without the light of Sun, or Moon, or Stars, or Candle, though you were not in pain, nor want of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther outward enjoyments, yet it would be no deſirable place to continue in. Oh then, what
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:43501:84"/> will be the ſadneſs, frights, and fears of theſe captives for ever, that ſhall be in pain, in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in darkneſs for ever? If a man were to live all his days in a Palace, there to have rich proviſions to feed upon, and beds of down to lodg upon, but yet to be always in the dark, would be a great affliction to him: Oh then, what will it be to live in pain and darkneſs too? to lye and roul and tumble in a bed of flames, in a lake of brimſtone, and in darkneſs too? to be amongſt Devils, and this in darkneſs too? and muſt not that be a place of darkneſs for ever, where the light of Gods countenance ſhall not ſhine upon the priſoners there for ever?</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a <hi>filthy priſon,</hi> full of noiſom ſtenches, and unſavoury ſmells; priſons are filthy places, very offenſive to the noſtrils, but the ſtench of the brimſtone ſhall be more troubleſome to the priſoners there, than the moſt ſtinking dungeon to any upon earth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is a <hi>ſtrong priſon;</hi> As it is ſo cloſe that none can come to them to comfort them, ſo it is ſo ſtrong that not a priſoner ſhall eſcape, or break through, or get out to all eternity; if once theſe priſon-doors be ſhut, and if Chriſt that hath the keys of death and hell, do once put thee in, and <hi>turn the key upon thee,</hi> there is no opening them for ever. Now you are bound in chains of your own making, even of your ſins; but hereafter you ſhall be bound in chains of Gods making. And there are four
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:43501:84"/> Bars or Bolts upon the priſon-gates of hell, that the priſoners ſhall be filled with deſpair of ever coming forth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This priſon-gates ſhall be made for ever faſt and ſtrong <hi>by the counſel and decree of God;</hi> God hath ordained, that the impriſonment of thoſe Captives that dye before they are made free, ſhall be eternal; it is the unalterable will of God, that they ſhall lye in chains for ever; Gods purpoſe muſt be changed before their chains can be broken, or the priſoners deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But God is a God that doth not change, he will be always in the ſame mind, and his Will will be the ſame for ever; therefore the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners muſt abide by it for ever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This priſon-gates ſhall be made faſt and ſtrong <hi>by the Juſtice of God.</hi> Juſtice ſhall keep the priſon-door, that not a priſoner ſhall come forth till he hath made ſatisfaction for his ſin, till he hath paid his debts to the uttermoſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and that will never be. When the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner hath been there a thouſand years, and ſhould beg, and pray, <hi>Lord, I have been here a thouſand years, it is a long time, a long time, O me-thinks it is a long time ſince the day I came into this place; my time of ſinning ſeemed ſhort, it was indeed but ſhort; but my time of ſuffering ſeemeth long, it is indeed exceeding long; now therefore Lord let me come forth.</hi> No, ſaith Juſtice, yet I am not ſatisfied. And when the other thouſand years be paſt and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This priſon-gates ſhall be made faſt upon the priſoners <hi>by the Truth of God.</hi> God hath told you in his Word, that this fire burns for ever, and that the ſinner that is not ſanctified ſhall be caſt into it, to lodg there for ever. The truth of God it is eternal truth; and ſo long as the Word of God abideth true, ſo long ſhall theſe Captives continue in this priſon.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This priſon-gates ſhall be made faſt and ſtrong <hi>by the Power of God.</hi> There ſhall be no getting out by force, nor by any oppoſition that they can make; the ſame power that ſent them thither, ſhall keep them that they ſhall neither dye in this priſon, nor eſcape out of it. If then the gates of this priſon be faſtened by the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable decree of God,</hi> by the <hi>Juſtice, Truth,</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of God, the priſoners might ſet their hearts at reſt, or rather ſhall never be at reſt, becauſe they never ſhall come forth from pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This priſon is far worſe than any other priſon, <hi>becauſe of the company that is there;</hi> and yet in many priſons there is a very wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed crew of ſwearing, curſing, and curſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; if a godly man were in ſome priſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſuch company, the company would
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:43501:85"/> be a greater affliction to him, than the priſon. But if the company of Devils, and Souls hating and blaſpheming God, be wicked company, this ſhall be found in hell, <hi>all bad, not one good amongſt the millions that are there;</hi> as in heaven, <hi>all good, not one bad amongſt the thouſands that are there.</hi> Here theſe captives ſin together, and they ſhall be in priſon all together, one curſing and crying out againſt another, that ever they were on earth acquainted with them. Nay, then the Devil and his Slaves ſhall be in priſon together, the conquerer and the conquered both caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a lake of brimſtone, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 41.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>The remembrance of the facts for which theſe captives ſhall be caſt into this priſon, will make it worſe than any other.</hi> To remember, here we are for obeying the Devil rather than God, for hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening to the temptations of the Devil, when we ſtopped our ears againſt all the cries, and calls, and counſels of God; had we but hearkened to the voice of mercy, to the entreaties of Chriſt, or to the exhortations of his Miniſters, we had now beenfree from this torment and this pain. Had we ſerved God as diligently, daily, and faithfully as we ſerved the Devil, we had been now in a better place, and we ſhould now have had a better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Oh, <hi>What are we damned for our pleaſing of our fleſh to the diſpleaſing of God!</hi> Do we ſuffer eternal pains for our folly, in preferring the ſhort pleaſures and profits of the world before God, the greateſt and the chiefeſt good! for my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:43501:86"/> of my palate! <hi>This is the fruit of my drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bouts!</hi> The wine in the glaſs was not ſo ſweet, as the wrath of God in this cup is bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which I have been a thouſand years a drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off, but cannot drink it off, but cannot drink it down, but cannot drink it up. Oh, better I had had ſo much ſcalding lead poured down my throat, than thoſe pleaſant cups for which I am now in greateſt pain. The thoughts of what they ſhall be in priſon for will make the priſon the more unpleaſant.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>The remembrance of a price and ranſom that was given for captives, and the benefit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of often tendered unto them, will make this priſon ſtill the more intolerable;</hi> There and then to remember, the Son of God came down from heaven, and did give himſelf, his blood, his Soul, to redeem ſinners out of bondage, and this was tendered unto me, ſaith one, and to me ſaith another, but I like a curſed and unthankful wretch did ſlight it and refuſe it, ſaith one; and I like a miſerable Caitiff did prefer my ſins and luſts before the Redeemer, ſaith another; we were often warned of this place, and often asked and intreated to accept of Chriſt, and deliverance by him; time was, that Miniſters in the Name of God did come unto us Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath after Sabbath, and in his name did offer liberty unto us; how often did they ask us, to be willing to leave our bonds, how earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:43501:86"/> did they beg that we would be but willing to have our fetters knocked off, and if we had been but willing, it ſhould have been done; but that time is paſt, thoſe ſeaſons are gone, and here we lye bound in fetters for ever.

                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. THe ſecond general Head contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the glad tydings to theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Captives, is that there is Liberty to be had by Chriſt; or, that it is by Chriſt, and Chriſt alone that poor captive ſinners are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and ſet at liberty. Had it not been for Chriſt, we muſt have periſhed in our Bonds, and remained in perpetual ſlavery while we had lived, and been for ever bound in chains of darkneſs, when we die. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 20. applied to Chriſt, <hi>Rom. 11. 26. Acts 4 12. John</hi> 8. 36.</p>
               <p>Man might be conſidered in a four-ſold State.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In his firſt condition <hi>as created by God:</hi> then man was a free-man, bondage came in by ſin: when man ſinned he loſt his freedom. And in this eſtate there was a three fold Liberty that man had.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Man was free from ſin;</hi> not the leaſt ſpot or ſtain by creation in this pure nature of man; he was then free from pride, and free from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate love of the world, and from every thing offenſive and diſpleaſing to God. <hi>Eccleſ. 7. 29.—God made man upright.</hi> The uprightneſs of a man
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:43501:87"/> renewed by ſanctifying grace denotes the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his heart, though there be ſin inherent in him. So <hi>Job</hi> was an upright man, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 1. But the uprightneſs of man at firſt created by God denoteth the perfect Image of God in the preſence of that which was good, and abſence of all ſin. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 26, 27.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Man had a freedom or <hi>liberty of will,</hi> to will and to do what God did require from him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>A freedom from all miſery,</hi> calamity and puniſhment. Man had then a freedom from ſickneſs, from ſorrow and from affliction and death; for all theſe are the fruits of ſin: Man had never been in bondage to theſe, if he had not become a bond ſlave to Satan and to ſin. And <hi>in this ſtate man had no need of a Redeemer,</hi> becauſe he was not then a captive.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Man might be conſidered in a ſtate of Corruption, and ſo his condition is quite contrary to what it was in his firſt eſtate; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was free, ſo now he is a ſlave, before at liberty, but now in bondage: and this bondage is oppoſite to the former three-fold Liberty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In man there is now a bondage to ſin, in ſlavery to his own luſts and to his own vile affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that there is no part in him free from ſin; his <hi>underſtanding</hi> is not free from ignorance, darkneſs and errour, his <hi>will</hi> is not free from obſtinacy and rebellion, his <hi>affections</hi> are not free from diſorder and confuſion, hating what
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:43501:88"/> he ſhould love, and loving what he ſhould hate, ſhunning what he ſhould deſire, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring what he ſhould ſhun, rejoycing in that which ſhould be the matter, cauſe and reaſon of his ſorrow, and grief, and grieving and being weary of that which ſhould be matter of his delight and joy. This is mans ſinful bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The very will of man is inthralled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> That though man hath a liberty of will as to natural acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and to civil actions, and to outward ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual actions, he can come and hear if he will, he can ſet upon the outward duty of prayer if he will; he can read the Word of God, if he will, yet he hath no liberty of will to ſupernatural actions without the grace of God, as to believe on Chriſt, to love God above all; man muſt have a will as well as a power from God to do theſe things. <hi>Phil. 2. 13. It is God that giveth us to will and to do of his own good pleaſure.</hi> And this is a ſore bondage, though a natural man feel it not, and is not ſenſible of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>In bondage by reaſon of puniſhment,</hi> being liable to all the curſes, plagues and puniſhments threatned for ſin in the Word of God, both in this life and that which is to come, to ſickneſs, and ſorrows, to pain and griefs, to death at laſt, and to hell and damnation after death. And <hi>in this eſtate man doth need a Redeemer, and a Ranſome,</hi> and is utterly and eternally undone if he be not delivered from this bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:43501:88"/>
               <p>3. Man might be conſidered <hi>in a ſtate of grace</hi> as recovered by Chriſt, as renewed and reſtored by the Spirit of God; for God doth not ſuffer all men to remain in their bondage, and thoſe that are redeemed and recovered muſt not aſcribe this to their own free-will but to the free grace of God. And in <hi>this eſtate man is made partaker in part of the fruits of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Man might be conſidered <hi>in a ſtate of glory.</hi> And there the Saints are all free, and altogether free, they have perfect liberty from ſin, from ſorrow, from temptations to ſin, from all incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to ſin, from a poſſibility of ſinning: and <hi>in this eſtate the Saints of God do fully and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally enjoy the fruits of Chriſts Redemption, and of his giving of himſelf a ranſom for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Qu. 1. <hi>What it is that we have not a liberty from by Chriſt the Redeemer.</hi> There are many things that Chriſt did not come to purchaſe or proclaim liberty from while we are in this life.</p>
               <p n="1">1. None of Gods Elect are freed by Chriſt <hi>from being born in original ſin;</hi> we are not born free, but are made free; even thoſe that are deſcended from free-men in Chriſt, are by birth in ſpiritual bondage: for grace doth not come by blood, but by the will of God, <hi>John</hi> 1. 13. No man ſince the Fall, except Chriſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer hath been free from this ſinful contagion
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:43501:89"/> that hath infected all mankind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. 17, 18.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt doth free us in this World <hi>from the indwelling of ſin;</hi> Chriſt doth free all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers from the <hi>reigning</hi> power of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14, but not from the <hi>conflicting</hi> power of ſin, no, nor altogether from the <hi>captivating</hi> power of ſin: the Lords free-men might ſometimes be overpowred with a temptation, and with a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and in a particular combate be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried captive, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23. nor doth Chriſt free us at all from the <hi>indwelling</hi> of ſin. As God did not preſently free the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from the Nations that did vex them, nor drive them out at once, but by degrees, he left ſome of them to prove them and to humble them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 28, 29. ſo all Gods redeemed and free ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants do ſtill experience the remainders of ſin and corruption, and do complain thereof and cry out becauſe of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. there are ſtill reliques of pride, and unbelief, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:43501:89"/>3. Chriſt hath not freed us <hi>from the ſervice of God,</hi> but rather doth engage us to it. Wicked men judg this to be liberty to live as they liſt, and to walk and act as they pleaſe, in gratifying their luſts and pleaſing of the fleſh. <hi>This is not liberty but licentiouſneſs;</hi> this indeed is the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage that Chriſt came to deliver us from. Oh how is the blind world miſtaken, when they take their very bondage for their liberty! The ſtricteſt Service of God is the greateſt Liberty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 45. It is not a liberty from duty, but from ſin and miſery, that Chriſt came to purchaſe and proclaim, <hi>Luke 1. 74, 75. 1 Pet. 2. 16. Rom.</hi> 6. 18. The moſt under the very Goſpel do live in the conſtant omiſſion of duty, and commiſſion of ſin, as if Chriſt came to give them liberty ſo to do: which yet they might have done if Chriſt had never come.</p>

All Gods Free-men will be hated by the Devils Slaves; and we ſhall not be freed from them, till we be out of their reach, and that will not be till we get to Heaven. Thoſe that have ſpiritual liberty, might loſe their civil liberty; as a man might have a civil liberty, but not ſpiritual; a man might be <hi>free of a City, free of a Company,</hi> and yet <hi>not free by Chriſt:</hi> ſo a man might be in priſon, bound in chains there, and yet be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually free; <hi>Joſeph</hi> in the priſon, <hi>Daniel</hi> in the den, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in the dungeon, and yet all the Lords Free-men. When Chriſt calls to many in their bondage to come to him to be made free, they would indent with Chriſt that they ſhould enjoy freedom from croſſes, and troubles, and ſufferings; which becauſe Chriſt doth not free his followers from, they had rather have their freedom from ſufferings in their bondage, than ſufferings with ſpiritual freedom.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Chriſt doth not give us freedom from temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Devil,</hi> that we ſhould be no more buffeted by that wicked one. Chriſt himſelf was not free from temptations from Satan, nor from perſecutions from men. Reſiſt the Devil, watch and pray againſt his temptations, for you are not like to be freed from them, till you get nto Heaven.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:43501:90"/>7. <hi>Chriſt doth not free us from the ſtroke of death;</hi> the Lords Free-men muſt be bound with deaths bonds as well as others. Our ſouls and bodies are not free from diſſolution, your bodies not free from putrefaction; but yet we are freed from the ſting of death; and death is not the ſame to the Lords Free-men, as it is to the Devils Bond-men.</p>
               <p>Q. 2. <hi>What is the liberty that we have by Chriſt?</hi> This ſhall be managed in ſpeaking to theſe two particulars. Firſt, As this liberty and freedom is <hi>privative.</hi> Secondly, As it is <hi>poſitive;</hi> or, what we are freed from; and what it is that we are freed to.</p>
               <p>1. What it is that believers are freed from by Chriſt; and theſe are great and ſore evils, and ſuch as would have made us unſpeakably and eternally miſerable, if Chriſt had not freed us from them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſt hath delivered us, and ſet us free from the power of Satan,</hi> that he hath no more rule in us as formerly he had; he did rule in our hearts, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 2; and we did yeild voluntary ſubjection and obedience to him; but Chriſt hath bound this ſtrong man, and ſpoiled him of his goods, and hath diſpoſſeſſed him, and turned him out of our hearts, from dwelling, reigning, ruling there, as in a Throne; this Chriſt came to do, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14, 15; he hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us from the Juſtice of God, by <hi>price and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:43501:91"/> purchaſe;</hi> from Satan, by <hi>power</hi> and by a <hi>mighty hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt hath ſet us free from ſin;</hi> not for the preſent, or in this life from the in-dwelling of ſin, as you heard before; but in theſe two reſpects:</p>
               <p n="1">1. By Chriſt believers have a <hi>freedom from the guilt of ſin.</hi> We are free from the obligation that lay upon us to eternal torments; ſo that now we ſhall never come into condemnation for our ſins; our many ſins are all pardoned, our great and heinous ſins are all forgiven, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1, 33, 34. Many might accuſe; the <hi>Devil</hi> might accuſe, and <hi>Men</hi> might accuſe, and <hi>Conſcience</hi> might accuſe, and the <hi>Law</hi> might accuſe us; but Chriſt hath ſo freed us, that none can condemn. Oh what a bleſſed piece of our freedom lieth in this! What wouldſt thou have done, to have anſwered for thy ſins? What wouldſt thou have done to bear the puniſhment of thy ſins? Indeed thou couldſt neither anſwer for thy ſelf, nor yet have born the wrath of God due to thee for thy ſin. Oh then ſee the everlaſting obligation laid upon thee to love this bleſſed Chriſt, to prize, and value, and eſteem this once crucified, and now glorious Chriſt, that hath taken off this obligation from thee; he hath freed thee from one obligation, and thereby laid upon thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; he hath freed thee from an obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to eternal condemnation, and hath laid upon thee a ſtrong and laſting obligation to love him,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:43501:91"/> and to praiſe and admire his love and grace to thee for ever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt hath ſet us free from the dominion of ſin.</hi> The Sinner was the Captive, and Sin the Lord and Conqueror; but he that is made free by Chriſt, is become the Conqueror, and Sin the Captive; the Victory indeed is not yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated, yet ſin is dethroned; the ſinner when a captive was in chains; but now made free, ſin is become bound. Sin was delighted in, but now it is abhorred; ſin was voluntarily yeilded unto, but now reſiſted and oppoſed; ſin was welcomly entertained, but now lamented and bewailed; it was looked upon with pleaſure and content, but now it is beheld with a ſorrowful heart, and with a weeping eye; it is become the burden and the grief, that before had the love and complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the ſinners heart; it is now prayed againſt, and watched againſt, and endeavoured againſt, that before was indulged, and allowed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, and willingly ſubmitted to. Now ſaith the Redeemed ſinner, my hard heart is a burden to me; my proud and unbelieving heart is a burden and a grief unto me; my vain and worldly heart is a burden, and a trouble, and a ſorrow to me; he is freed from the reigning power of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>Chriſt hath ſet believers free from the curſe of the Law.</hi> The Law hath its uſe under the Goſpel; by it we come to the <hi>knowledg of ſin,</hi> Rom. 3. 20, and 5. 20; by it we are <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:43501:92"/> of our miſery,</hi> that by ſin we have deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved death and damnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 10. that we might <hi>ſee the neceſſity of Chriſt,</hi> and haſten the more to him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 24. It <hi>ſerveth for a rule</hi> to direct us in our walking, and for <hi>a glaſs</hi> in which we ſee the imperfection of our duty and obedience, that we might not reſt in them, nor truſt unto them for life and ſalvation. But from the condemning-ſentence and curſe of the Law, Chriſt hath made believers free, by being made himſelf a curſe for them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10, 13.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Chriſt hath ſet believers free from the hurt of death.</hi> The Lords Free-men muſt dye as well as the Devils Bond-men; but Death will be another thing to a Free-man, than it is unto a Captive: ſo that which is formidable to a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, is deſirable to a Saint. Chriſt hath taken away the ſting of Death, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 55: of an Enemy is become a Friend; and Death, that is one of the plagues that befall the Devils Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, is become part of the Charter of the Lords Free-men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22.</p>

                  </gap>h to Free-men of the Lord is the <hi>utter abolition of their ſin;</hi> it ſhall free them from the very being and in-dwelling of ſin: when the ſoul ſhall be ſeparated from the body, all ſin, and all corruption ſhall be ſeparated from the ſoul: whereas the Devils bond-men dye in their ſin, and after death do ſtill retain their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred unto God, their enmity to Chriſt, and are
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:43501:92"/> more confirmed and hardned in it than before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Death to the Lords Freemen <hi>puts an end to all their ſorrow and affliction,</hi> to all their troubles and their ſufferings. It is Gods <hi>Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,</hi> whereby he wipes away all tears from the eyes of his redeemed people, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 13. but at death the ſorrow of the Devils Captives doth begin, or is encreaſed; if they were at eaſe while they lived, they ſhall be in pain when they dye: if they did roar and ſing while they lived, they ſhall roar and lament after death: Death takes them from their riches, from their friends, and from their pleaſure, and whatſoever was dear unto them in this worlds enjoyments, and puts them into a place of pain and torment, a place of utter darkneſs, where they ſhall for ever weep and howl, and fruitleſly lament their woful ſtate, and their irrecoverably-loſt-happineſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Death to the Lords Free-men is <hi>the gate to glory, and their paſſage and entrance into eternal life:</hi> It is the opening of the door to let them into their Fathers houſe; a Meſſenger ſent by God to fetch them into the preſence of their God and Redeemer, to live, and reign, and dwell with him for ever; that their freedom here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun might be conſummated and perfected in heaven. In that very day they dye, they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as free Citizens of the glorious Kingdom of God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 22.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Death to the Lords Free-men <hi>ſhall come in the beſt time.</hi> All men dye in Gods time, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:43501:93"/> he appointeth; but the redeemed by Chriſt ſhall dye in the beſt time, when their work is done, and when God ſeeth it is better for them to dye than to live; God takes the beſt time and fitteſt ſeaſon for the removing of his by death out of the world: But the wicked ſlaves of ſin and Satan are cut off in <hi>a bad time,</hi> when-ever they dye; it is a bad time to them, becauſe when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is, they go that day to hell, and to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal torments; the day of their diſſolution is the day of their damnation; and will not that be the ſaddeſt day they ever had? <hi>they dye before their work is done;</hi> before they have believed, and before they have repented, and that muſt be a ſad day when-ever it comes. Men cut down Weeds at any time, but the Corn in the beſt time, in the fitteſt ſeaſon, when it is ripe to be carried into the barn.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Death to the Lords freemen <hi>hath loſt its terribleneſs.</hi> And though all Gods redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are not actually and totally freed from the fears of death, but ſometimes kept in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage through the fears of death; yet they have grounds and reaſons why they might not fear it: But the Devils Captives have always cauſe and reaſon to be terribly afraid of death; and if they be not, it ariſeth from the blindneſs of their minds, and the hardneſs of their hearts. <hi>It is a wonder, that men ſhould be as near to hell as to the grave, and yet not be afraid to dye; It is a wonder, that men ſhould be as near to an
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:43501:93"/> endleſs miſerable life, as they are to the end of this ſhort uncertain life, and yet their fears ſhould not prevent their ſleeping in the night, and their jovial merriments in the day-time.</hi> The Devil hath <hi>blinded</hi> them as well as <hi>bound</hi> them, and that is one reaſon of it. But theſe cannot upon any ſolid, rational, and religious grounds be freed from the fears of death. But ſo may the Lords freemen, and this they have from and through Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14, 15.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Chriſt will ſet believers free <hi>from the grave by a joyful reſurrection;</hi> that though they come under the ſtroke and power of death, and are lodged in the grave for a while, yet it ſhall be but for a while. Death and the grave ſhall not always have dominion over their body. Death doth bind them, but Chriſt will looſe theſe bonds, and will ſet them free; as Chriſt did break the bonds of death, for death was not able to hold him in his grave, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 24. So he will knock off the fetters of death from all his, and bring them forth, and make them happy; and this as ſurely as he himſelf is riſen, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 13, &amp;c. And not only free them out of the grave, but alſo from thoſe evils and imperfections that in this life their bodies are ſubject to; that though they ſhall have the ſame bodies for ſubſtance that now they have, yet they ſhall be better bodies as to the qualities that they then ſhall have.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then Chriſt will free them from <hi>that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:43501:94"/> that now they are ſubject to;</hi> now liable to death every day and hour, but then they ſhall dye no more for ever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then Chriſt ſhall free them <hi>from all pain and ſickneſs,</hi> from cold, and hunger, and thirſt they are now often ſenſible of; their head ſhall never ake, their hearts ſhall never be ſick, no part in the leaſt pained to all eternity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Then Chriſt ſhall free them <hi>from a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of food to ſuſtain them,</hi> and of nouriſhment from the uſe of creatures, by which they are repaired and ſupported daily on this ſide the grave, but on the other ſide of the grave they ſhall need this no more than the Angels do in heaven.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Then Chriſt ſhall free them <hi>from that wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs that now our bodies often feel, and do groan under;</hi> for he will make them ſtrong and powerful bodies. Now-a-days work in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God doth weary our bodies; but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after though they ſhall be imployed through an endleſs eternity, in praiſing and glorifying of God, they ſhall neither be weary of it through wickedneſs, nor weary in it through weakneſs, for as much as Chriſt will free them from both, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 42, 43.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Chriſt will then ſo free them <hi>from all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections that they ſhall be made like to Chriſts glorious body.</hi> And can we deſire greater freedom for our bodies, than to be made like to Chriſts glorious body, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 21.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:43501:94"/>6. Chriſt doth <hi>free all his from the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hell,</hi> that when the Devils Captives ſhall be pained and tormented by exquiſite and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable puniſhment, rowling and tumbling, ſhrieking and howling, and with bitter cries la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting themſelves, the redeemed of Chriſt ſhall never be touched with the flames of that fire; the <hi>ſecond death ſhall have no power over them, Rev.</hi> 20. 6. Chriſt will take care, that thoſe that love him above all, and chuſe him before all, ſhall never come into condemnation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16, 18. Oh what mercy is this, to be freed from hell! Oh what grace and kindneſs is this, to thoſe that once were Captives, and had deſerved it, and were in danger of it, that by Chriſt they ſhould be freed and delivered from it! Oh what mercy would the damned, that have felt the pains and puniſhment of hell, think, ſay, and confeſs it to be, if they may be let out, and freed from it: But they are in it, and ſhall never be delivered from it; but the Lords free-men are out of it, and ſhall never be caſt into it; ſo great is the liberty we have by Chriſt the Redeemer of Captives, in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of what we are freed from.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What are the poſitive bleſſings that by Chriſt we are made free unto.</hi> For Chriſt did come to poor ſinners, to redeem them when Captives, not only that they ſhould not be miſerable, but that they ſhould alſo be happy. Theſe things
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:43501:95"/> are many and great and glorious; let me give you a taſte in theſe few:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>By Chriſt believers have freedom and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to come to the throne of Grace.</hi> A burden to wicked graceleſs hearts it is, to come and pray to God, are backward to it, weary of it, as if it were a part of their ſlavery and bondage, to come and beg for mercy for their ſouls, for pardon for their ſin, for converting and renewing grace now, and for eternal endleſs glory hereafter, Judg of this as you will, yet know it coſt Chriſt dear to purchaſe this liberty for us; it is not only a duty that we <hi>muſt,</hi> but it is a real priviledg that we <hi>may,</hi> have the freedom to come to God upon our knees, to beg for ſpecial, ſpiritual, temporal and eternal mercies. Would not a poor priſoner, that hath deſerved to dye, account it a priviledg to have liberty as oft as he will, and when he will to have liberty of acceſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King, to prefer his petitions to him, and to beg for a pardon of his fact, and for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of his life; and all this with hopes of ſpeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and obtaining what he doth petition for? When man had ſinned, he was driven out of Paradiſe, and was afraid becauſe of guilt, and there was no freedom for the rebellious ſinner without Chriſt, to come before a provoked an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry God with hopes of mercy; but there is a new and living way now found out for you, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 19, 20, 21, 22. that you might come with freedom, and ask with freedom of ſpirit,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:43501:95"/> and with freedom of ſpeech, what Chriſt hath purchaſed for you, and God hath promiſed to you, <hi>Eph. 3. 12. Heb.</hi> 4. 16. You may with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom come to God, and tell him all your <hi>grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,</hi> and all your <hi>burdens,</hi> and all your <hi>temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> and all your <hi>wants,</hi> and open all your <hi>heart</hi> unto him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>By Chriſt believers have a freedom and a liberty to apply the promiſes of the Goſpel to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> Theſe promiſes are <hi>many, great,</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> promiſes, of <hi>many, great,</hi> and <hi>precious</hi> things, and you are free to them all; not only free to read them, but free to apply them to your ſelves, and to live upon them, and to wait and hope for the fulfilling and performance of them. Here is a promiſe of pardon, and it is made to me; a promiſe of more grace and of perſeverance, and it is made to me, a promiſe of eternal life and glory, and the bleſſed glorious God hath made it unto me, and by Chriſt I may freely apply it, and build and reſt upon it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>By Chriſt we are made free to all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of redeemed people.</hi> Theſe are alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, great, and precious; very many, very great, and very precious priviledges.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Believers by Chriſt are free to a ſtate of friendſhip and favour with God.</hi> As there is a a freedom betwixt friends, ſo there is betwixt God and his redeemed by Chriſt, that are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the benefits of his redemption; from a ſtate of enmity to a ſtate of friendſhip and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation;
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:43501:96"/> God is no more your enemy, nor you any longer enemies to God, a peace is made by Chriſt betwixt God and your ſouls, and this is a firm, and laſting, an everlaſting peace, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 20, 21. Now with comfort thou may'ſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, though men do hate me, yet God doth love me; though men are my enemies, yet God is my friend, my ſureſt and my faſteſt friend.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>By Chriſt Believers are free to a ſtate of Juſtification, the righteouſneſs of Chriſt is freely imputed to them.</hi> That as the Devils Captives are under the imputation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſo the Lords freemen are under the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Chriſts righteouſneſs and obedience, <hi>Rom. 5. 19. 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 21; and you are free to truſt to, and to plead the righteouſneſs of Chriſt for your Juſtification in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>By Chriſt believers are made free to a ſtate of Sonſhip, and the priviledg of Adoption.</hi> Of Slaves you are become not only Servants out Sons; of the children of the Devil, are become the children of God; of the children of Gods wrath, the children of his love. Men may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem Captives, but do not adopt them for their children; but all that Chriſt redeems, have the liberty to become the Sons of God, <hi>Joh. 1. 12. 2 Cor.</hi> 6. latter end.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>By Chriſt believers are free to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God in his Ordinances.</hi> God is no longer a ſtranger to them, nor they any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſtrangers unto God; but have ſweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:43501:96"/> and fellowſhip with God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 3. They come to duty, and meet with God in duty; in praying, hearing, and receiving, they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the gracious, powerful, and heart-quickening, and ſoul-comforting, chearing, ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning influences of the Spirit of God, and of the goings forth of their Souls in love unto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after, and delight in God. And when it is ſo, how ſweet is this unto their Souls!</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>By Chriſt believers are free to a right to heaven, and to the enjoyment of the bleſſed glorious God for ever in his Kingdom.</hi> They are made free to the happineſs of the life to come; they ſhall have free admiſſion into the heavenly Paradiſe; the gates of heaven ſhall be ſet wide open for their departing Souls, freely, without any ſtop or hinderance; they are free in part now, and they ſhall be perfectly free among the Saints in glory when they dye, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 21. This glory is prepared for them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 34; and they are prepared for it, <hi>Rom. 9. 23. Col.</hi> 1. 12. And what ſhall be your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs then, is beyond the power and ability of any man upon earth fully to declare unto you, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8. It might be better done by a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Angel that is in poſſeſſion of it, than by a ſinful (though ſanctified) man, that lives, and waits, and hopes, and prayeth in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. Yet the very names by which it is called, might help you to ſome conceptions of the greatneſs of its excellency and glory: (1) It is
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:43501:97"/> called a <hi>Crown,</hi> and that which far ſurpaſſeth all earthly Crowns, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4, 5; a Crown of <hi>life, Jam.</hi> 1. 12; a Crown of <hi>righteouſneſs, 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 8; a Crown of <hi>glory, 1 Pet.</hi> 5. 4. (2) It is called a <hi>Kingdom, Mat.</hi> 25. 34. (3) It is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>our Maſters joy, Mat.</hi> 25. 21, 23. (4) It is called <hi>our Fathers houſe,</hi> and the houſe of the Father of our Lord Jeſus, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 2. (5) It is called <hi>the inheritance of the Saints in light, Col.</hi> 1. 12. (6) It is the <hi>purchaſe of Chriſt, Eph.</hi> 1. 14. (7) It is called <hi>eternal life, Rom.</hi> 6. 23. Beſides theſe names by which it is called, dwell in your thoughts upon one Text that ſets it forth, till you find your hearts to be affected with it, and long to be poſſeſſed of it, and that is 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17, where you obſerve how the Apoſtle proceeds by ſteps to come to the top-expreſſion of this happineſs to which you are made free.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is called <hi>glory.</hi> Now free in <hi>grace,</hi> then in <hi>glory.</hi> The thought of that glory would dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and diſgrace the greateſt glory of this world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is called a <hi>weight of glory;</hi> not a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſom weight, not a weight to weary you; are your afflictions weighty? ſo ſhall your glory be; but afflictions are but light, if compared to the weight of glory.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is an <hi>exceeding weight of glory;</hi> it doth exceed all worldly glory.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is a <hi>more exceeding weight of glory;</hi> more than can be conceived.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:43501:97"/>5. It is a <hi>far more exceeding weight of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. It is <hi>eternal</hi> too. All this is not for a little while only, or for ſome thouſands of years only, but for ever and for ever. The glory of the world, as it is but light, if weighed with this; ſo it is but fading and tranſitory, and but ſhort, if compared with this that is eternal. Thus you have a little view (and alas it is but little) of the poſitive freedom and liberty that you have by Chriſt.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Freemen have their ſpiritual eye-ſight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored unto them.</hi> When Chriſts opens the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon-doors to let the Captives out, he doth alſo open their eyes, to let them ſee that in ſin, in God, in Chriſt, in grace and holineſs, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they never ſaw. That the redeemed Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive crieth out, Oh I never thought my heart had been ſo bad, ſo bad, ſo very bad as now I ſee it is: I never thought, that ſin had been ſo vile, ſo very vile, and ſo deformed as now I plainly ſee it is: I never thought that Chriſt was ſo excellent, and ſo neceſſary, ſo abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary for me, as now I ſee he is; Oh me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks he is now altogether lovely, altogether deſirable; after I have had a view of the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the excellency of Chriſt, methinks all the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:43501:98"/> glory of the world, and all the delights in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and ſin is darkened, and doth vaniſh and diſappear: Oh how was I blinded in my cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, that I never ſaw the excellency of Chriſt, and deformity of ſin till now, <hi>Iſa. 42. 6.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>When Chriſt breaks the bonds wherewith poor Captives were held, he alſo breaketh their hearts that they have been kept and held there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in the ſervice of Satan and ſin, from God and Chriſt ſo long.</hi> As the eye doth ſee and weep, ſo the heart doth conſider, and bleed, and grieve at the remembrance of his former folly and ſin. Oh what did I do to ſin againſt this bleſſed, gracious, merciful God! Oh what did I mean ſo long to ſtop mine ears againſt all the calls, and wooings, and intreatings of this Lord-Redeemer, who was ſo kind to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, bleed, and dye for ſuch a wretch as I, for ſuch a wretch as I, for ſuch a rebellious, diſobedient, and delaying wretch as I. Oh there is no love like his, there is no mercy like to his, there is no kindneſs like to his! Oh why did I ſlight him ſo much, ſo long, ſo very much, ſo very long as I have done! Oh what a fool was I, to prefer the world, the pleaſures and the profits of the world, before this bleſſed Redeemer! Oh what a beaſt was I, to prefer my very luſts and ſins, and the ſervice of the Devil, before this glorious, gracious Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and the ſerving of him that died to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver

I weep, but not enough; my heart is troubled, but not enough; my Soul is humbled within me, but not enough, for ſo great rebellion againſt, and ſlighting of this Lord Redeemer. But I am troubled becauſe I am no more troubled; Lord I grieve, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my heart is yet ſo hard, and can grieve no more; my ſin is bitter unto me now, which once was ſweet and pleaſant to my Soul.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Such as are made free by Chriſt, are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the reigning power of ſin.</hi> For it is impoſſible to be a willing voluntary ſervant of ſin, and yeild obedience to the Law of ſin, and to be made free by Chriſt, 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 19.

For the Condition of ſinners being partakers of Chriſts Redemption is their believing on him, and conſenting to him as Lord and Saviour, chuſing him before all, and loving him above all; and if this you do not do, you are yet in your bondage to Satan and to ſin.</p>

Is the Redeemer come, and wilt thou not mind him? hath he paid the ranſom, and waiteth for thy acceptance of him, and wilt thou ſtill refuſe him, and the liberty and freedom thou mayeſt have by him, and canſt not have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him?

If thou will not remember liberty was offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thee, and thou didſt refuſe it, thou wouldſt not be free. Though thou haſt been a very vile ſinner, and rebellious, yet thou mayeſt be made free, <hi>Pſal. 68. 18. Iſa.</hi> 49. 6. Do theſe things.</p>

This is the undoing of multitudes, that they conclude their condition to be good, when it is not ſo; and they conclude before they try. Did you but ſee your bonds, and underſtand your ſlavery, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters would have hopes that by their Sermons they may do you good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Work upon thy heart by ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thy miſery and deplorable condition while thou art in a ſtate of bondage.</hi> When by dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſearch thou haſt found thy ſelf in a bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage-condition, hold thy thoughts unto this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject till thou art awakened and affected with it; think with thy ſelf, and ſay, Oh my ſoul! being yet a Captive to Satan and to Sin, thou art yet an enemy to God, a ſlighter of Chriſt, under the guilt of all thy ſin, in danger of damnation; awake, ariſe, and look about thee, and get out of this condition, leſt it be too late for ever.</p>

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:43501:101"/> you in the Name of God about your being made free. So indeed it is 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19, 20.

Did you believe this, would you ſit and ſleep as if what were delivered to you were not worth the hearing and regarding? or would you ſit and hear, and go away and ſlight all that hath been ſaid unto you?</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Make application of the Word of God, when you hear it, unto your ſelves.</hi> This is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto me, this is my miſery, and this is my condition, and this is my danger; and mercy offered to ſinners, is offered unto me; and Chriſt is tendered unto me to help me out of my woful ſtate of bondage. The Miniſter maketh Uſes of the Doctrine he delivers, but all this is ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, till you take it and lay it home to your own hearts: for want of this, you ſit and hear like people not concerned; you ſit and hear without affection, and go away without the due and powerful effect of the Word upon your hearts. Let Conſcience tell thee, thou art the Drunkard, the Hypocrite, the Unbeliever, that is threatned and in danger of damnation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Look up to God through the Ordinance,

               <p>Firſt, <hi>Be thankful unto God and Chriſt,</hi> that of bond-men you are made free.

I ſhall never forget your kindneſs while I live. I do acknowledg I have not ſuch another friend that hath done the like for me, in all the world.</hi> Foraſmuch then as the difference of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a debtor to God, and a debtor to man; of being expoſed to a priſon upon earth, and to the priſon of Hell, is unſpeakably great, methinks you ſhould break forth into holy admirations of the grace and love of God, and ſay, <hi>O Lord, I was indebted unto thee in the debt of ſin, and of that I am diſcharged and freed: and now I am indebted in the debt of thankfulneſs unto thee: O the riches of this grace! O the greatneſs of this love and favour! Was ever love like this? Was any kindneſs ever comparable to the kindneſs and the bounty which thou haſt ſhewed to my ſoul? O
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:43501:102"/> Lord, I am forced to cry out, I never had, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can have in heaven or in earth, ſuch another friend as thou haſt been and art unto my ſoul!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But alas, O Lord, I find my heart exceeding dull and dead; a ſmaller kindneſs from a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creature would have greatly affected me, and have made deep impreſſions on my heart; but by ſad experience, and to the grieving of my Soul, I find, I am too too ſtupid and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of this manifeſt and matchleſs mercy, which thou haſt freely vouchſafed unto me! I believe, that there are many now in the helliſh priſon, as certainly as if I ſaw them with mine eyes, where I alſo might have been; and I ſee others in this world ſtill Captives to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, faſt bound in the cords and chains of luſt and ſin, that are going to the place of that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed damned crew of loſt ſouls, eternally ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the enjoyment of thy bleſſed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, amongſt whom thou haſt given me good hope through grace I ſhall never be; thou ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt mercy unto me, while thou poureſt out thy wrath and fury upon them. Oh whence is this! and how comes this to paſs? why am I poor ſilly wretch partaker of this love? what didſt thou ſee in me but filth and ſin, that might have provoked thee to deal with me as thou haſt done with them? ſurely, Lord, thou hadſt mercy on me, becauſe thou wouldſt have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on me! when I did lye in my blood, and bonds, in my fetters and my chains of ſin and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:43501:103"/> guilt, thou didſt paſs by me, but didſt not paſs me by, but ſhewedſt grace and goodneſs to me! When thy Servant and Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> was in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, bound with chains, and the keepers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the door kept the priſon, thou didſt ſend thine Angel, who came upon him, and a light ſhined in the priſon, and he ſaid unto him, <hi>ariſe up quickly,</hi> and his chains fell off from his hands; but when I was in a worſer caſe, and ſorer condition, having fetters on my Soul, and darkneſs in my underſtanding, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil the keeper of the priſon ſtood to watch me, to keep me in his ſtrong hold, thou didſt ſend thy Son (for an Angel could not do it) to knock off thy chains wherewith I was held, and thy Spirit came upon me, and a light did ſhine into my mind, and he ſaid, Ariſe up quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the chains fell off from my Soul: all this thou didſt for me, a Captive and a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and it was long before I knew that it was true which was done for me: but while I think and muſe hereon, how I was bound, and now am ſet at liberty; how I was inthralled, and in great diſtreſs, and thou haſt enlarged me; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to find and feel my love to kindle in my breaſt, and my heart to be enlarged with thy praiſe; and as thy Apoſtle did ſit in the priſon and ſing, ſo ſhall my ſoul, being brought forth and delivered from captivity, magnifie thy name.

               </p>
               <p>To quicken your hearts to real thankfulneſs for deliverance from this Bondage, and captivity, dwell in your thoughts upon theſe Particulars following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The greatneſs of your Debt for which you were expoſed to everlaſting impriſonment.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider here the kinds of your ſins, the number and the aggravations of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Work upon your thoughts your utter inability and incapacity to make payment of your Debt,</hi> for want of which you might have been a Priſoner for ever. You could not ſay to God as the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant did to his fellow-ſervant that demanded his Debt of him; <hi>Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all,</hi> Mat. 18. 29. There was a double Debt that you owed unto God, one as a reaſonable creature, the other, as an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſinner: the firſt was the debt of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence required by the Law, the other the debt of puniſhment for the tranſgreſſion of the Law; and you could have paid neither of them; Not
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:43501:104"/> the debt of perfect and perpetual Obedience; Firſt, becauſe all that you can do is due for the preſent, and that which is due for the preſent will not be accepted as payment for that which is paſt: as if a Tenant owe for Rent, due ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny quarters paſt, the payment of what is the rent of the laſt quarter will not ſatisfie for all that was due before. Secondly, all that you could do is leſs than what you ought to do; and in ſtrict juſtice a part of payment is not accepted for the whole; every living man comes far ſhort of his duty to God, and runs more and more in arrears with God, and therefore ſo far from paying that we run daily behind hand. Thirdly, man in bondage had not the leaſt mite of that kind which the Law requireth and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, to wit, ſinleſs, ſpotleſs and perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience without mixture of ſin, pure gold with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any droſs; and if the Priſoner offer for his liberty money that is not current, the Creditor may refuſe it, and keep him in the Priſon ſtill. And as you could not pay the debt of obedience to the Law, ſo neither could you ſatisfie for the debt of puniſhment due to you for your diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience thereunto: the payment or ſatisfaction muſt be equivalent to the wrong that was done. God that was offended is an infinite God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which ſatisfieth, that the Offender might be free, muſt be ſomething of an infinite value, which no meer man had to give to God; and therefore thoſe Priſoners that are not ſet free
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:43501:104"/> by Chriſt ſhall be always paying, but can never fully pay; ſatisfying, but can never fully ſatisfie; and therefore ſuch ſhall never be releaſed, but muſt lie in Priſon for ever.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, weigh alſo this, <hi>ſatisfaction muſt be made, or the Priſoner never have his liberty.</hi> God might, and did demand his Debt. When <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, <hi>Hue and Cry</hi> was made after the Offender, <hi>Adam, Where art thou?</hi> was apprehended and arraigned at the Bar, <hi>What haſt thou done?</hi> Haſt thou eaten of the fruit of the Tree, of which I commanded that thou ſhouldſt not eat? He was convicted by his own Confeſſion, <hi>I did eat;</hi> and was condemned and a ſad ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence paſt upon him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 17, 18, 19. This was the pitiful caſe that man was in, ſinned he had, apprehended he was, found guilty, under ſentence, juſtice required ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: man could not give it; and thus he knew not which way to turn himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for help &amp; for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from his Bondage and Captivity which by ſin he had brought himſelf unto. Oh what a ſtrait were you in, when you owed millions, and had not one mite to pay? after you have pauſed upon this, Conſider,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>To releaſe you from your Bonds Jeſus Chriſt did voluntarily undertake for you, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe himſelf betwixt the wrath of God and the poor Captive, enthralled ſinner; as if Chriſt ſhould ſay, Father, man that was made free, hath abuſed his liberty and is become a Bond ſlave, fallen into
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:43501:105"/> the hands of revenging juſtice, which might arreſt him, and clap him up in Priſon for ever; I ſee he is undone and loſt; help himſelf he cannot, but I will be his Surety and his Bail; what he oweth thee, ſet that on my account, I will pay it. I am willing to do and ſuffer in their nature what may pleaſe and ſatisfie thy juſtice; if my life will be taken for their ſalvation, I will lay it down, if my blood will be accepted for the ranſom of theſe poor Priſoners I will ſhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l it for them, rather than that they ſhall always remain in this Captivity.</hi> Oh can you think how ready Chriſt was for to engage, and to become your Surety, to die for you, that you might live, to be bound for you, that your Bonds might be broken, and your ſoul eſcape, and not have your heart affected with his love, and your tongue imployed in his praiſes? <hi>Jer. 30. 21. Who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? ſaith the Lord.</hi> Who is this forward En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gager, that is ſo willing and hearty in this work? It is one that is able and mighty to ſave, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem by price and power, poor Captive Sinners, even the only Son of the ever bleſſed God; and ſo he is ſaid to be our Surety, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. A Surety is one that undertakes for, or gives aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the behalf of another; one entring into Bond and ſtanding engaged for another to do &amp; to perform for another, what he was bound to do. Among men Suretiſhip is a dangerous thing; he diſſures his own eſtate that is ſurety for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Prov. 11. 15. He that is ſurety for a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:43501:105"/> ſhall ſmart for it: and he that hateth ſureti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is ſure.</hi> But notwithſtanding ſuretiſhip is thus among men, yet Chriſt would become a Surety for us to God himſelf, to bring us forth from our Bondage; and that you might be the more affected, and inflamed with his love, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how far he acted for poor Captives beyond what ever man did for any man.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>How many Captives Chriſt engageth for!</hi> How many millions he became a Surety for, for their ranſom and deliverance! one man might be bound, and become a Surety for one, or two, but who will be Surety for thouſands? eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if you add,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The greatneſs of the Debt of thoſe he became a Surety for;</hi> One man might be perſwaded to be Surety for another, if the Debt be ſmall; but if it be for thouſands and for millions, men are ſhie, but if it be for multitudes that owe ſuch great ſums, every one ſo much, who will be perſwaded to be Surety for them? but if they be in Priſon or in Bondage there they lie for want of money of their own, or Suretiſhip from another. But Chriſt became Surety for multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, and each one owed abundance, that it doth paſs the skill of the ableſt Arithmetician to caſt up the total ſum that one of theſe Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were in Bondage for.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt knew moſt certainly that he ſhould pay undoubtedly the Debt of all, he became a Surety for.</hi> Many men are Sureties for others, hoping
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:43501:106"/> they ſhall never be called upon for the Debt, but that the Debtor will pay it himſelf; ſome will be bound for a man, whom they judg to be worth as much as they owe and more too; but if it be a poor man, not worth one farthing, and his debt be thouſands, Who will then become Surety for him? a Priſoner he is, and ſo he is like to be: and if any become bound for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and pay the debt for him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what trouble doth this cauſe unto him? it breaks his ſleep &amp; he is diſpleaſed with himſelf, that ever he entred into Bond, and ſaith it ſhall be a warning to me, while I live, how I become a Surety for another; I thought him able enough, elſe I would not have brought my ſelf into ſuch ſnares.</p>
               <p>But all this was known to Chriſt, when he did become our Surety. He knew our beggary and our poverty, and that we could not contribute the ſmalleſt mite, towards the ſatisfaction to be made in order to the freeing of the Captives from their Bondage; and he knew that God would not ſpare him, but exact the utmoſt from him, and yet he did voluntarily undertake our ranſom. Oh what love was this!</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Chriſt became a Surety for you, when you were a ſtranger to him.</hi> He did undertake to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe you out of your Bonds and Fetters when you had no ſpecial actual relation to him. Some men will not be Sureties for their moſt intimate acquaintance, and near relations, not for a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, father, ſon, but for a ſtranger who will do it?
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:43501:106"/> herein then admire the love of Chriſt that when you were in Chains of ſin and guilt, and a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger too, Chriſt did undertake and did pay a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom for you.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Yet more to affect your heart, Conſider, <hi>that Chriſt did ranſom you from your Captivity when you were an enemy unto him.</hi> A man might poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly take ſome pity on a ſtranger, but an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that hates him, and that would and doth diſhonour and reproach him, who would be deeply engaged for him? yet Chriſt did this for you, when you were enemies unto Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Yet to raiſe your admiration and affection more, Conſider <hi>Chriſt did become a Surety for you, before you did or could deſire any ſuch kindneſs at his hands.</hi> What Man or Angel could have thought of the ranſoming of Captives by the Son of God, becoming the Son of Man, and God himſelf redeem us by his blood? How long might you ask, how many might you go to? and how many entreaties might you uſe before you can prevail with one to be engaged for you for much, when you have nothing of your own? but Chriſt did this for us all, before any man had any ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in his heart, thought in his mind, requeſt in his mouth, that he would do ſo great and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a kindneſs for us.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Chriſt did this alone, without any other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging with him.</hi> Men require counter-ſecurity. If I be bound for you (ſaith one) you ſhall find
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:43501:107"/> to be bound with me, to be bound to me, to ſave me harmleſs; or you ſhall make over ſuch houſes, or ſuch lands for my ſecurity, that if I be called upon, or the Bond be put in ſuit againſt me, I might ſave my ſelf: But as Chriſt did tread the wine-preſs of Gods wrath alone, ſo did he alone undertake to ranſom and redeem us from our bondage and captivity.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Chriſt did never repent of this undertaking, nor deſired to ſtand bound no longer.</hi> Men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged for others, when they fear they will fail, make all means they can to get out of the bond, and to ſtand ſurety no longer; they will ſcarce ſleep till they have got themſelves free, though the party that is the principal debtor be arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and put in priſon. But Jeſus Chriſt our Lord-Redeemer and Surety, to bring us out of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage was conſtant to the death; and when <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> did diſſwade him from ſuffering (which was the payment of our ranſom), how ſharply did Chriſt rebuke him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 21, 22, 23? Yea he was deſirous of the time of actual performance, <hi>Luk. 12. 50, I have a baptiſm to be baptized with, and how am I ſtraitned till it be accompliſhed.</hi> Chriſt never ſaid, it doth repent me, that I did ever undertake to ranſom Captive ſinners; God ſaid indeed, it did repent him that he made man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 6; but Chriſt never did repent that he had engaged himſelf to redeem ſinners.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Conſider what it was that was the price that Chriſt did give to make you free from your cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity.</hi>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:43501:107"/> Men might be Surety for men to pay a ſum of money; but Chriſt became our Surety to the ſhedding of his own moſt precious blood. Men might give ſome money to redeem a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive from <hi>Turkiſh</hi> ſlavery; but Chriſt <hi>himſelf,</hi> his <hi>life,</hi> his <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>body,</hi> to bring us from our bitter bondage, and miſerable captivity. Thus take ſome time to ponder upon the Lord your ſurety, that did ſo freely undertake the ranſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your captivated Souls. Which was the fourth head to get your hearts affected with this priviledg of being ſet at liberty.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Conſider, <hi>That God was pleaſed to accept of the undertaking of Chriſt, and what he hath laid down for your ranſom from cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity.</hi> God might have exacted the debt from man that did owe it. It is a voluntary act for a man to become a ſurety, no man is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to it; and it is a voluntary act of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor to accept of ſuch a ſurety, they are both free and at their choice; but when the one offers himſelf to become bound, and the other doth accept of his ſuretiſhip, then is the debtor or priſoner relieved.</p>
               <p>It was free love in Chriſt to become our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer; it was grace in God to accept of Chriſts ranſom for us. The Son might have ſaid, <hi>Man hath ſinned, why ſhould I ſuffer? man hath deſerved the wrath of God, let him undergo it:</hi> And the Father might have ſaid, <hi>Man hath tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:43501:108"/> my Law, and violated my Covenant, and I will make him ſuffer for it; they have brought themſelves into bonds of miſery, and they ſhall lie therein, and they that ſinned, themſelves ſhall die.</hi> Oh wonder then at this bleſſed agreement between the Father and the Son, for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth poor Souls in Bondage from their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, From all the former it follows, <hi>the Salvation of ſuch as are made free, is ſure and certain.</hi> Heaven now belongeth unto you; and the glory above you have a title to; Doth Satan object againſt you, that you have ſinned, and deſerved to lie in everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chains, you might reply: it is true, but Chriſt is my Surety and Redeemer, and hath ſet me free? Doth the Law or Conſcience ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe you, you might anſwer all from the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of your Redeemer. Do you fear the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, why your Debt is paid by your Surety, and then the Debtor cannot be caſt into Priſon. The Surety and the Debtor in Law are but one Perſon, and the Surety is liable to make ſatisfactory payment, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 26, 27. and Chriſt hath done it, and you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged.</p>
               <p>God hath given ſome to Chriſt, whom he is to bring to Heaven; and they ſhall not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, <hi>John</hi> 6. 38, 39, 40. as <hi>Judah</hi> did engage to <hi>Jacob</hi> for <hi>Benjamin; Gen. 43. 9. I will be Surety for him, of my hands thou ſhalt require
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:43501:108"/> him: if I bring him not unto thee, and ſet him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever.</hi> And therefore when <hi>Benjamin</hi> was to be detained by <hi>Joſeph, Judah</hi> pleads hard, and offers himſelf to abide in his ſtead and to be a Bondman there; ſo that <hi>Benjamin</hi> might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his Father with his Brethren <hi>Gen.</hi> 44. 33. Chriſt hath undertaken to bring all thoſe out of their Bonds and Fetters, which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gave unto him, and to ſet them in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before him. The price is paid, the Bonds are broken, the Chains fallen from your Souls, in which you were held while unconverted: as he hath opened the <hi>Priſon-doors</hi> that you might come forth, ſo he will open to you the <hi>Palace-gates</hi> that you may enter in: for hopes hereof be thankful, be exceeding thankful and rejoyce in the Lord your Redeemer.</p>
               <p>Second Exhortation. The next Duty I would preſs upon you <hi>is, to be compaſſionate, and to put on tender bowels of pity towards thoſe that yet are bound in the Fetters and Chains of their ſin and guilt;</hi> whileſt you do rejoyce in that you are free, do not forget to commiſerate them that yet are Captives.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let <hi>Miniſters think of this</hi> when they are ſtudying for, and praying for, and preaching to their people, how they be in Bondage and in ſlavery, and that except their Chains be
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:43501:109"/> looſed and their Fetters broken and knocked off, their ſouls are loſt for ever, and that they will be faſter ſhortly bound hand and foot and caſt into a place of outer and eternal darkneſs; ſome ſerious and believing thoughts of their preſent danger, and their future mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery would put more life into all we do for their recovery and prevention of their everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condemnation. Should we then preach unto them with ſuch lukewarmneſs, as if we were telling them a tale, or ſaying ſuch things in that manner, as if we did not believe our ſelves the things we do declare? or as if it were no matter whether our hearers did believe, receive and obey the Meſſage we deliver to them or no? when yet they be the great and weighty truths of everlaſting Life or Death: to preach a Redeemer to Captive ſouls what skill and life, and love doth it require? what zeal and pity to their ſouls doth it call for? Oh that God would pardon the want of theſe in me, give me that belief of their eternal ſtate and ſeriouſneſs of heart, that I may ever ſpeak and preach the Doctrine of Redemption to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved ſinners, as to thoſe that are undone for ever, except they be prevailed with to come to him, ſubmit to him, accept of him, and give up themſelves to be His <hi>wholly,</hi> and to be his <hi>only</hi> that hath paid the ranſom for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance. When ſome years ſince I was called
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:43501:109"/> occaſionally to preach to the <hi>Priſoners in New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> and ſaw my Hearers come in Fetters, and heard their Chains ratling at their heels, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts it was an affecting ſpectacle to ſee men before me that were ſhortly to be called to the Bar of Men, and be tried for their lives, and ſome likely to be ſentenced to death and put to execution: but if we do behold our Hearers ſtanding before us, though free from ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Chains of Iron, yet bound faſt in their luſts and ſins, and conſider they muſt be ſhortly tried at the Bar of God, and if not delivered by Chriſt, muſt receive a ſentence of death, baniſhed from the preſence of the bleſſed God, caſt down to Devils and damned Spirits, it ſhould move us to pray for them, weep over them, and preach unto them with greateſt pity and compaſſion. To ſtand and view ſo many perſons, amongſt whom many are the Devils Captives, whom he is leading Fettered to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal perdition, ſhould raiſe in our hearts ſtrong workings of affection towards them, and ſpeak unto them with that earneſtneſs and tender love, as becometh thoſe that are ſpeaking in the Name of God to loſt ſinners in order to their recovery and deliverance from Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Let Parents that are made free, pity and compaſſionate their Children that yet are bound.</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:43501:110"/> If any of your Children ſhould be laid in Irons for ſome Fact committed againſt the Laws of men, and carried Bound to Execution, would not this like a Sword pierce your very hearts, be matter of grief and trouble to you? would not tears plentifully flow from your eyes, and bitter lamentations from your mouth, that ever you ſhould bring forth, and bring up children that ſhould end their days in ſuch reproach and infamy to you and them? or if any of you had a Son abroad, and you ſhould hear he were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Captive by the <hi>Turks,</hi> or were in the <hi>Spaniſh Inquiſition,</hi> what ſhedding of tears! what wringing of hands! what ſmiting on your breſt would theſe tidings make! what dolorous complaints and grievous moans would you make! ſaying, <hi>O my Son, my Son, my poor afflicted and diſtreſſed Son, thou art fallen into the hands of barbarous and cruel men; thou art put to drudgery and ſlavery! O my Son, my Son, what ſhall I do for thee, my Son. Oh that I could give or find a ranſom for him! if all I have would ſet him free, he ſhould not lie in Chains and Fetters, nor conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in that ſore Captivity!</hi> Why, you Parents! would you thus lament the miſery of your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens body, and do you make nothing of the the miſery of your Childrens ſouls! would you thus take on, and grieve and mourn for their outward bondage, which is conſiſtent with the good condition of their ſouls, and will ſhortly
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43501:110"/> have an end, and yet is it nothing to you, to ſee them in their ſpiritual bondage, captivated by Satan, and in danger of being caſt into an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Dungeon of black and thick darkneſs! Oh why do you not ſpeak to them, and tell them of their miſery and their remedy; how they came into this condition, and how they may get out of it? why do you not, day and night plead with them, inſtruct them, and exhort them, that they may eſcape the torments of Hell here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, by being brought out of their bondage now? why do you not pray to God, that he would make them free? why do you not plead at the throne of grace, and ſay, <hi>Lord, I have Children that are Satans Captives, my poor Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are faſt bound in Fetters of ſin, in the Bonds of iniquity: O thou God of grace, that haſt ſhewed favour unto me, ſhew favour to my children alſo! Oh that they may be releaſed! Oh that thou wouldſt pleaſe to pity them in their Bondage, and for the ranſom of thy Son let them be redeemed, and by the powerful workings of thy ſpirit have their wills ſubdued, and inclined to accept of the only Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; him thou didſt ſend to proclaim liberty to Captives, Oh that by thy grace thou wouldſt cauſe them to come in, and lay hold upon the mercy gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the proclamation of the Goſpel, that they might not periſh in their Bonds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Let Maſters that are made free and ſet at liberty have compaſſion on their ſervants that are
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:43501:111"/> fettered in their Chains of ſin.</hi> They are not only bound to you (to be ſo bound is in order to their good and their freedom) but are alſo bound in the Cords of their iniquity, which is their preſent ſlavery, and tendeth to their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal miſery; doth it not pity you, to ſee your ſervants, to be ſervants of the Devil, and in bondage to their luſts? doth not your hearts work within you to conſider that any under your Roof, ſhould be drudges unto Satan? or do you ſee this, and have you nothing to ſay unto them all the week long, to make them apprehenſive of their danger, and ſenſible of their miſery? is it enough for you to teach them the skill and art of your trade, and at the expiration of ſeven years to make them free, while you do neglect to help them (as inſtruments under God) out of the thraldom of Satan and of ſin? or can it ſatisfie you that they have at the end of their Service to you, the <hi>freedom</hi> of the City or Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration where you and they do dwell, while they are not brought into the liberty of the Sons of God? or can you have peace in the neglect of your duty, to think they came into your family Bond-ſlaves to ſin, and after ſeven years time, they go out as they came in? or ſhould you not endeavour that they may be ſpiritually free, while they continue ſervants unto you? Oh how would they have cauſe to bleſs God for you, and that ever they came within your doors,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:43501:111"/> and dwelt within your walls, if they may ſay, when I firſt became a Servant to my Maſter, I was a ſervant to my luſts alſo, but by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, admonitions, and example, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a ſervant of God, before I ceaſed to be a ſervant unto him? if it ſhould be otherwiſe, let it not be through your neglect; for as it will not be without ſin and miſery to your ſervants, ſo neither will it be without guilt on you.</p>
               <p>The like I might urge upon other relations, acquaintance and friends, husbands to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on their wives, wives on their husbands, one Neighbour on another; you that know what it is to have been in theſe curſed Bonds, and what it is to be made free, do your utmoſt to help and ſuccour them that be in chains of ſin, and and know not the evil of it, nor the good of the contray condition; and therefore mourn not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the one, nor deſire to be brought forth into the other.</p>
               <p>Third Exhortation. <hi>Were you in Bonds, and are they broke? in Fetters and are they knocked off? then walk in the whole courſe of your lives as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a ranſomed and redeemed people.</hi> It will not become you to live and act as others do; as there is a wonderful difference between your condition, and the condition of others, ſo there muſt be, betwixt your converſation and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of others. See that you be humble,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43501:112" rendition="simple:additions"/> holy, heavenly: ſee that you be fruitful in every good work: faithful to your Lord-Redeemer, and be no more intangled with thoſe ſins and ſnares you are delivered from. Now you are enlarged, walk cloſe with God, holy-ſtrictneſs is the greatſt and the trueſt liberty. <hi>Pſal. 119. 45.

Go on then, Hold on your way, continue and perſevere therein to the end, and when the ſervants of ſin, at the coming of Death, and the Day of Judgment, ſhall be bound in a place of darkneſs, pain and torment, you ſhall be free in a place, a Palace of reſt and light, of life and love, ſinging, ſounding forth the everlaſting Praiſes of your Redeemer.</p>
